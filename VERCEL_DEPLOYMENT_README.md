# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the application to Vercel using the provided scripts.

## Prerequisites

1. Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
2. Vercel account and logged in via CLI (`vercel login`)

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Create Deployment Package

Run the silent package creation script:

```
.\create-vercel-package-silent.bat
```

This script will:
1. Build the TypeScript code
2. Copy necessary files to a deployment directory
3. Install production dependencies
4. Create a deployment-manual.zip file
5. Suppress verbose output to prevent terminal overflow

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

Use the PowerShell deployment script for silent deployment:

```
powershell -File silent-deploy.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Check if the deployment package exists
2. Verify Vercel CLI is installed
3. Extract the deployment package silently
4. Deploy to Vercel with minimal output
5. Clean up temporary files

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Ensure you're logged in to Vercel (`vercel login`)
2. Check that the deployment package exists at the specified path
3. Verify your Vercel project configuration
4. Check your internet connection

## Environment Variables

Make sure all required environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings.

## Deployment URLs and Testing

### Understanding Vercel Deployment URLs

Each deployment to Vercel creates a unique URL with the following format:
```
https://radorderpad-[unique-id]-capecomas-projects.vercel.app
```

When testing against a specific deployment, you need to ensure you're using the correct URL:

1. To list all deployments and their URLs:
   ```
   vercel ls
   ```

2. The most recent deployment will be at the top of the list.

### Updating Test Scripts

When deploying fixes, you need to update test scripts to point to the new deployment URL:

1. Check the current URL in test scripts (usually in `test-fixed-implementation-production.js`):
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = process.env.PROD_API_URL || 'https://radorderpad-[unique-id]-capecomas-projects.vercel.app/api';
   ```

2. Update it with the new deployment URL from `vercel ls`.

3. Run the tests again to verify the fix.

### Common Issues

- If tests fail with database errors like "column does not exist", ensure you're testing against the correct deployment URL.
- Each deployment is independent, so fixes in one deployment won't affect others.
- To make a deployment the production URL, use `vercel --prod` with the project name.

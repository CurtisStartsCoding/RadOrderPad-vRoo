# RadOrderPad Validation Engine Documentation

This directory contains the consolidated documentation for the RadOrderPad Validation Engine. The documentation has been organized into logical sections based on audience and purpose to eliminate redundancies and provide a clear source of truth for each aspect of the validation engine.

## Documentation Structure

### Frontend Documentation (`/frontend`)

Documentation for frontend developers implementing the validation workflow in the user interface.

- **[validation-engine-integration.md](./frontend/validation-engine-integration.md)**: Technical guide for integrating with the validation engine from a frontend application. Covers API contracts, state management, error handling, and implementation patterns.
  
- **[validation-workflow-guide.md](./frontend/validation-workflow-guide.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the validation workflow, including the user-facing process, best practices for clinical dictation, and implementation considerations.

### Backend Documentation (`/backend`)

Documentation for backend developers working on the validation engine implementation.

- **[validation-engine-architecture.md](./backend/validation-engine-architecture.md)**: Detailed overview of the validation engine architecture, including components, data flow, configuration, and error handling.
  
- **[validation-engine-implementation.md](./backend/validation-engine-implementation.md)**: Implementation guide with code examples, configuration details, and best practices for developers working on the validation engine.

### Testing Documentation (`/testing`)

Documentation for QA engineers and developers testing the validation engine.

- **[validation-engine-testing.md](./testing/validation-engine-testing.md)**: Comprehensive test cases and procedures for the validation engine, including expected results, troubleshooting guidance, and monitoring strategies.

### Product Documentation (`/product`)

Documentation for product managers and UI designers working on the validation workflow.

- **[validation-feedback-logic.md](./product/validation-feedback-logic.md)**: Detailed explanation of how validation feedback is generated, structured, scored, and displayed to the referring physician.

## Audience-Based Guide

### For Frontend Developers

Start with [validation-engine-integration.md](./frontend/validation-engine-integration.md) for technical integration details, then refer to [validation-workflow-guide.md](./frontend/validation-workflow-guide.md) for a broader understanding of the workflow.

### For Backend Developers

Begin with [validation-engine-architecture.md](./backend/validation-engine-architecture.md) for an overview of the system architecture, then dive into [validation-engine-implementation.md](./backend/validation-engine-implementation.md) for implementation details.

### For QA Engineers

Focus on [validation-engine-testing.md](./testing/validation-engine-testing.md) for test cases, expected results, and troubleshooting guidance.

### For Product Managers

Review [validation-workflow-guide.md](./frontend/validation-workflow-guide.md) for a high-level understanding of the workflow, then explore [validation-feedback-logic.md](./product/validation-feedback-logic.md) for details on feedback presentation.

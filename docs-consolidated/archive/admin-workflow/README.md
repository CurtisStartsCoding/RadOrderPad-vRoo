# Archived Admin Workflow Documentation

This directory contains the original admin workflow documentation files that have been consolidated into the new structure in `docs-consolidated/admin-workflow/`.

## Purpose

These files are preserved for historical reference only. For the most up-to-date and comprehensive documentation, please refer to the consolidated documentation in the `docs-consolidated/admin-workflow/` directory.

8. **frontend-explanation/API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE/order-management.md**: Contains sections related to admin order management endpoints

## Consolidated Documentation

The consolidated documentation in `docs-consolidated/admin-workflow/` organizes this information into a more logical structure:

1. **README.md**: Overview and navigation guide

3. **api-integration.md**: API details and integration guide
4. **implementation-details.md**: Backend implementation details

6. **testing-reference.md**: References to test files with explanations

## Note on Testing Files

The test files for the admin workflow remain in their original location in the `all-backend-tests/scripts/` directory. The `testing-reference.md` file in the consolidated documentation provides references to these files with explanations.

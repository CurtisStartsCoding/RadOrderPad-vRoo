  - Glenohumeral subluxation
  - Rotator cuff tears (more common in RA patients)
  - Acromioclavicular joint involvement
  - Subchondral cysts

- **Advanced Disease:**
  - Extensive erosions
  - Joint destruction
  - Secondary osteoarthritis
  - Ankylosis (rare in shoulder)
  - Rotator cuff arthropathy

### Differential Diagnoses
- Osteoarthritis (central, not marginal erosions; osteophytes)
- Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (chondrocalcinosis)
- Rotator cuff tear arthropathy (superior migration of humeral head)
- Septic arthritis (rapid joint destruction, clinical signs of infection)
- Crystalline arthropathy (gout, pseudogout)
- Psoriatic arthritis (less symmetrical, may have periostitis)
- Polymyalgia rheumatica (typically minimal radiographic changes)

### Special Considerations
- **Pediatric Patients:** Juvenile idiopathic arthritis may present differently; growth plate involvement should be assessed.
- **Pregnant Patients:** Ultrasound preferred; MRI without gadolinium if necessary.
- **Elderly Patients:** Consider concomitant degenerative changes that may complicate interpretation.
- **Immunocompromised Patients:** Higher suspicion for infection; consider aspiration and culture when appropriate.

## Misdiagnosis Codes
- **M19.011** (Primary osteoarthritis, right shoulder; central wear pattern rather than marginal erosions, osteophytes present)
- **M75.100** (Unspecified rotator cuff tear or rupture of right shoulder, not specified as traumatic; superior migration of humeral head, absence of erosive changes typical of RA)
- **M12.511** (Traumatic arthropathy, right shoulder; history of trauma, post-traumatic changes)
- **M10.011** (Idiopathic gout, right shoulder; asymmetric involvement, tophi may be present)
- **M86.811** (Other osteomyelitis, right shoulder; more focal bone destruction, abscess formation)

## Rare Disease Considerations

### Uncommon Variants
- **Rheumatoid Nodules in Periarticular Tissues:**
  - Soft tissue masses visible on ultrasound or MRI
  - May cause mechanical symptoms
  - Consider when unexplained soft tissue masses are present

- **Rapidly Destructive Shoulder Arthritis:**
  - Accelerated joint destruction within months
  - Mimics septic arthritis or neuropathic arthropathy
  - Consider when there is rapid progression of joint damage

- **Milwaukee Shoulder Syndrome:**
  - Destructive arthropathy associated with calcium hydroxyapatite crystal deposition
  - Massive rotator cuff tears with superior migration of humeral head
  - Consider in elderly patients with RA and rapid shoulder destruction

### Special Imaging Findings
- Rheumatoid vasculitis may present with bone infarcts visible on MRI
- Amyloidosis secondary to long-standing RA may show characteristic infiltration patterns
- Rice bodies (fibrin bodies) in joint fluid may be visible on MRI as multiple small filling defects

## Code Information
**ICD-10 Code:** M06.812
**Description:** Rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid factor of left knee

## Imaging Recommendations

### Primary Imaging Studies

1. **Conventional Radiography of Left Knee** 
   - **CPT Code:** 73560 (Radiologic examination, knee; 1 or 2 views)
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 9
   - **Rationale:** First-line imaging for rheumatoid arthritis evaluation. Provides assessment of joint space narrowing, periarticular osteopenia, marginal erosions, and soft tissue swelling. Useful for establishing baseline disease status and monitoring progression.

2. **MRI of Left Knee without Contrast**
   - **CPT Code:** 73721
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 8
   - **Rationale:** Indicated when radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion for synovitis is high. Superior for detecting early inflammatory changes, bone marrow edema, synovitis, and cartilage damage not visible on radiographs. Particularly valuable for early disease detection.

3. **Ultrasound of Left Knee**
   - **CPT Code:** 76881 (Ultrasound, complete joint)
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 8
   - **Rationale:** Excellent for detecting synovitis, effusions, and superficial erosions. Allows dynamic assessment and comparison with contralateral knee. Cost-effective for monitoring disease activity and treatment response.

### Secondary Imaging Studies

1. **MRI of Left Knee with Contrast**
   - **CPT Code:** 73722
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 7
   - **Rationale:** Consider when needing enhanced visualization of synovitis or when evaluating for complications. Contrast helps distinguish active synovitis from inactive pannus and better delineates extent of inflammation.

2. **CT of Left Knee without Contrast**
   - **CPT Code:** 73700
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 6
   - **Rationale:** May be useful for detailed evaluation of bone erosions and structural damage, particularly when MRI is contraindicated. Provides excellent bone detail but limited soft tissue assessment.

3. **Nuclear Medicine Bone Scan**
   - **CPT Code:** 78315 (Bone and/or joint imaging; 3 phase study)
   - **Appropriateness Rating:** 5
   - **Rationale:** Consider for polyarticular disease assessment when systemic involvement is suspected. Helps identify clinically silent but metabolically active joints.

## Clinical Notes

### Key Findings to Look For
- Periarticular osteopenia (early finding)
- Symmetric joint space narrowing
- Marginal erosions, particularly at joint margins
- Synovial thickening and joint effusion

## Clinical Notes

### Key Findings to Look For
- **Early Disease:**
  - Soft tissue swelling
  - Periarticular osteopenia
  - Joint effusions
  - Synovial thickening on ultrasound or MRI

- **Established Disease:**
  - Marginal erosions (typically beginning at the \"bare areas\" where cartilage doesn't cover bone)
  - Uniform joint space narrowing
  - Joint subluxation and deformities (ulnar deviation, boutonnière deformity, swan-neck deformity)
  - Ankylosis in advanced cases

### Differential Diagnoses
- Psoriatic arthritis (asymmetric distribution, DIP involvement, pencil-in-cup deformities)
- Erosive osteoarthritis (central erosions, DIP/PIP predominance)
- Crystal arthropathies (gout, pseudogout)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (non-erosive arthropathy)
- Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (sacroiliac involvement)

### Special Considerations
- **Pediatric Patients:** Growth plate involvement may lead to growth abnormalities; consider juvenile idiopathic arthritis protocols
- **Pregnant Patients:** Ultrasound preferred; avoid radiographs when possible
- **Elderly Patients:** Differentiation from osteoarthritis may be challenging; look for distribution pattern
- **Immunocompromised Patients:** Consider opportunistic infections that may mimic or complicate rheumatoid arthritis

## Misdiagnosis Codes
- **M15.9** (Polyosteoarthritis, unspecified; distinguished by central rather than marginal erosions and osteophyte formation)
- **M10.9** (Gout, unspecified; distinguished by asymmetric involvement and predilection for first MTP joint)
- **M11.9** (Crystal arthropathy, unspecified; distinguished by chondrocalcinosis on imaging)
- **M07.3** (Psoriatic arthropathies; distinguished by DIP involvement and asymmetric distribution)
- **M45.9** (Ankylosing spondylitis, unspecified; distinguished by sacroiliac joint involvement and syndesmophytes)

## Rare Disease Considerations
- **Rheumatoid Nodulosis:** Predominantly subcutaneous nodules with minimal synovitis; imaging may show nodules without significant joint erosions
- **Rheumatoid Vasculitis:** Consider angiography or vascular ultrasound when systemic vasculitis is suspected
- **Felty's Syndrome:** Splenomegaly may be detected on abdominal imaging studies
- **Rheumatoid Lung Disease:** Consider HRCT chest when pulmonary involvement is suspected (interstitial lung disease, rheumatoid nodules)
- **Cervical Spine Involvement:** Consider dedicated cervical spine imaging when neurological symptoms are present to evaluate for atlantoaxial subluxation

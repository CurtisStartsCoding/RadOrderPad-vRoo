# Frontend API Integration Todo List

**Created:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** June 2025  
**Purpose:** Master checklist for implementing API integration in RadOrderPad frontend  
**Priority:** Focus on core workflow first (Phase 1) to get orders flowing to radiology

## Major Accomplishments (June 2025)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin Order Finalization: Save functionality works but EMR parser has issues
- ‚úÖ Send to Radiology: Working with real radiology organizations from connections
- ‚úÖ Dynamic Facility Selection: Loads real locations based on selected radiology org
- ‚úÖ Connections Management: Complete implementation with request/approve/reject flow
- ‚úÖ Location Management: Full CRUD operations with filtering and formatting
- ‚úÖ Navigation: Fixed menu access for Connections page
- ‚úÖ API Integration: Unified endpoint for order updates
- ‚úÖ Fixed targetFacilityId: Now uses correct facility ID instead of organization ID

## Critical Issues
- üî¥ EMR Parser not updating patient names (first/last name fields)
- üî¥ Only partial field updates when parsing EMR data

## CRITICAL PATH - Phase 1: Core Order Workflow (Week 1)

  - [ ] Display credit cost (1 credit per order)
  
- [x] **Implement Send to Radiology API** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Replace mock handler with real API call
  - [x] Use endpoint: `POST /api/admin/orders/:orderId/send-to-radiology`
  - [x] Pass `radiologyOrganizationId` in request body
  - [x] Handle success response with remaining credits
  - [x] Handle insufficient credits error (code: 'INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS')
  - [x] Navigate to `/admin-queue` on success
  - [x] Show success toast with radiology org name

### 1.2 AdminOrderFinalization - Save Patient/Insurance Info [PRIORITY: HIGH] ‚úÖ BACKEND FIXED

- [x] **Add Save button to Patient Info tab** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Place button next to "Continue to Insurance"
  - [x] Add loading state for save operation
  
- [x] **Implement patient info save API** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Use endpoint: `PUT /api/admin/orders/:orderId/patient-info`
  - [x] Convert camelCase to snake_case for API (firstName ‚Üí first_name)
  - [x] Handle partial updates (only send changed fields)
  - [x] Show success toast: "Patient information saved"
  - [x] Show error toast on failure
  
- [x] **Add Save button to Insurance Info tab** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Place button next to "Continue to Order Details"
  - [x] Add loading state for save operation
  
- [x] **Implement insurance info save API** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - [x] Map frontend fields to API fields (insurerName, policyNumber, etc.)
  - [x] Handle partial updates
  - [x] Show success/error toasts

- [x] **BACKEND FIX: Data Retrieval Issue** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (January 2025)
  - [x] Fixed `GET /api/orders/:orderId` to JOIN with `patients` and `patient_insurance` tables
  - [x] Added patient fields: `patient_first_name`, `patient_last_name`, `patient_city`, `patient_state`, `patient_zip_code`, etc.
  - [x] Added insurance fields: `insurance_name`, `insurance_policy_number`, `insurance_group_number`, etc.
  - [x] Added supplemental EMR content: `supplemental_emr_content`
  - [x] **Result**: Saved data now shows when returning to order finalization page

- [x] **UNIFIED ENDPOINT IMPLEMENTATION** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (June 2025)
  - [x] Backend created unified `PUT /api/admin/orders/:orderId` endpoint

    - [x] Patient info save uses unified endpoint with `patient: {}` wrapper
    - [x] Insurance save uses unified endpoint with `insurance: {}` wrapper
    - [x] Order details save uses unified endpoint with `orderDetails: {}` and `supplementalText`
  - [x] All data now saves with camelCase field names
  - [x] Fixed date of birth persistence by checking both `patient_date_of_birth` and `patient_dob`
  - [x] **Result**: All tabs now save correctly with the unified endpoint

**üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES - Must Fix:**
1. **Patient Names Not Updating**: EMR parser returns first/last names but they don't populate in form
2. **Inconsistent Field Updates**: Some fields update, others don't (seems random)
3. **No Error Feedback**: When parsing fails partially, user has no indication
4. **Form State Issue**: Possible React Hook Form state management problem

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if parser returns correct field names (firstName vs first_name)

## üìã Implementation Notes

### API Request Pattern
```typescript
const response = await apiRequest('METHOD', '/api/endpoint', requestBody);
if (!response.ok) throw new Error('API Error');
const data = await response.json();
```

### Field Mapping
Backend uses snake_case, frontend uses camelCase:
- firstName ‚Üî first_name
- dateOfBirth ‚Üî date_of_birth
- phoneNumber ‚Üî phone_number
- addressLine1 ‚Üî address_line1
- zipCode ‚Üî zip_code

### Error Handling
- Check for `error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS'`
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Handle network failures gracefully

### Testing Each Feature
1. Test happy path first
2. Test error scenarios
3. Verify data persistence
4. Check UI updates
5. Test with different user roles

### Important Backend Quirks
1. **Send to Radiology**: Endpoint is `POST /api/admin/orders/:orderId/send-to-radiology` (no longer uses -fixed suffix)
2. **Field Names**: Unified endpoint uses camelCase, old endpoints use snake_case
3. **Credit System**: Each order sent consumes 1 credit
4. **Order Status**: Orders must be "pending_admin" to appear in queue
5. **Radiology Orgs**: Admin staff CAN fetch via connections API - use active connections with radiology type
6. **Date of Birth**: Backend may return as either `patient_date_of_birth` or `patient_dob`
7. **Unified Endpoint**: `PUT /api/admin/orders/:orderId` accepts nested objects (patient, insurance, orderDetails, supplementalText)
8. **Order Details Limitations**: 
   - Radiology group selection not saved (no backend field)
   - ~~Facility location needs ID mapping (currently hardcoded to 1)~~ ‚úÖ FIXED - Now uses real facility IDs
   - Scheduling timeframe field doesn't exist in database yet
9. **Connections API**: 
   - Returns wrapped response: `{ connections: [...] }`
   - Uses `isInitiator` boolean to determine request direction
   - Connection IDs are different from organization IDs
   - Can only approve requests TO your organization (not FROM)
10. **Navigation Fixes**:
    - Connections menu item added to AppHeader.tsx for admin roles
    - Menu shows in hamburger menu on all screen sizes
11. **API Response Inconsistency**:
    - Connections API: `{ connections: [...] }`
    - Locations API: `{ success: true, data: [...] }`
    - Orders API: `{ orders: [...], pagination: {...} }`
    - See technical debt document for standardization plan

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Orders can be created by physicians
- ‚úÖ Admin staff can process and send orders
- ‚úÖ Credits are tracked and consumed properly
- ‚úÖ Organizations can manage users and locations
- ‚úÖ Billing/payment flow works end-to-end

This comprehensive todo list focuses on getting the core workflow operational first (Phase 1), then building out the supporting features needed for a complete system. Each item is specific and actionable, making it easy to track progress.

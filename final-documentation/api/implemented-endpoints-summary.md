## Important Implementation Notes

### 1. EMR Parser Enhancement
The system includes an enhanced EMR parser (`emr-parser-enhanced`) that improves accuracy when processing pasted EMR text. Tests show it achieves 90%+ accuracy on realistic, messy EMR data.

### 2. Dual Credit System
Radiology organizations use a dual credit system:
- Basic credits: For standard imaging (X-ray, ultrasound)
- Advanced credits: For complex imaging (MRI, CT, PET, Nuclear)
Credits are automatically consumed based on imaging type.

### 3. Field Naming Conventions
- Patient info endpoints use **snake_case** (e.g., `first_name`, `date_of_birth`)
- Most other endpoints use **camelCase**

### 4. Known Limitations

1. **Admin Staff Cannot List Radiology Organizations**
   - Frontend must provide radiology organization selection
   - Test uses hardcoded `radiologyOrganizationId: 2`

2. **Response Field Issues**
   - Some fields return `undefined` even when operations succeed
   - Frontend should handle undefined fields gracefully

3. **HL7 Export Not Implemented**
   - Only PDF, CSV, and JSON export formats work

4. **File Upload from Node.js**
   - S3 upload had CORS/signature issues in Node.js environment
   - Should work properly from browser with correct headers

## Endpoints NOT Yet Tested

The following endpoints are implemented in the codebase but not yet tested:

1. Super Admin endpoints (`/api/superadmin/*`)
2. Stripe webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/stripe`)
3. Some specialized endpoints like trial order validation

## Recommended Testing Priority

For frontend integration, prioritize testing in this order:

1. **Authentication flow** - Login and token management
2. **Physician workflow** - Order creation and validation
3. **Admin staff workflow** - Order processing and sending to radiology
4. **Scheduler workflow** - Managing incoming radiology orders
5. **File uploads** - From browser environment
6. **Billing integration** - Credit purchase and usage tracking

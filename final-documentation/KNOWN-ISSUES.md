# Known Issues and Troubleshooting

**Last Updated:** June 17, 2025

This document tracks known issues, their current status, and workarounds.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

### 1. Location-Based Filtering Not Implemented

**Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

**Severity**: High - Multi-location organizations see all orders from all locations

**Issue Description**:
Orders are not filtered by location. Admin staff in multi-location organizations can see and access ALL orders from ALL locations, which is a significant privacy and workflow issue.

**Details**: See [CRITICAL-LOCATION-INTEGRATION-GAP.md](CRITICAL-LOCATION-INTEGRATION-GAP.md) and [LOCATION-INTEGRATION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](LOCATION-INTEGRATION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)

### 2. Admin Staff Cannot Access Connection Locations

**Status**: Permission issue - needs authorization update

**Severity**: High - Prevents admin staff from selecting specific radiology group locations

**Issue Description**:
Admin staff users cannot retrieve location information for connected radiology groups. When selecting a radiology group to send an order to, they can see the organization but cannot access the organization's locations, preventing them from routing orders to specific facilities.

**Current Behavior**:
- Admin staff can view list of connected radiology organizations
- Clicking on an organization does not load its locations
- API returns 403 Forbidden or empty location list
- Orders can only be sent to the organization level, not specific locations

**Impact**:
- Cannot route orders to specific radiology locations
- Multi-location radiology groups receive all orders at organization level
- No way to distribute workload across different facilities

**Root Cause**: 
Admin staff role lacks permission to access the connections/locations endpoint or the endpoint doesn't properly authorize admin_staff role.

**Temporary Workaround**: 
None available - admin staff must manually coordinate with radiology groups about which location should handle orders

**Permanent Fix Required**:
1. Update API endpoint permissions to allow admin_staff to access connection locations
2. Verify `/api/connections/:connectionId/locations` includes admin_staff in authorized roles
3. Update frontend to properly display location selection for admin_staff users

**Related Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/connections` - Works for admin_staff
- `GET /api/connections/:connectionId/locations` - Currently blocked for admin_staff
- `PUT /api/orders/:orderId` - Needs location_id for proper routing

## ðŸŸ¡ Known Limitations

### 1. Package Management on Production

**Issue**: Production deployment uses `npm prune --production` which removes all devDependencies, including TypeScript types. This can cause build failures if package.json is modified.

**Workaround**: 
- Avoid modifying package.json dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- If changes are required, ensure production server runs `npm install --include=dev` before building

### 2. Redis Search Limitations

**Issue**: Redis search indexes may become out of sync with database

**Workaround**: 
- Run `node debug-scripts/force-redis-population.js` to force repopulation
- Check index health with `node debug-scripts/redis-optimization/check-index-schema.js`

## ðŸŸ¢ Resolved Issues

### 1. S3 Upload - SignatureDoesNotMatch (Resolved June 17, 2025)

**Issue**: S3 file uploads were failing with 403 Forbidden errors in production but working locally

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Wrong AWS Credentials in Test Environment**
   - Test scripts were using `radorderpad-ses-user` credentials which had `AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV3` policy blocking S3 access
   - Correct credentials were in `.env.production` but test scripts loaded empty `.env.test`

2. **Typo in Production Server Credentials**
   - AWS Secret Key had lowercase 's' instead of uppercase 'S' at position 15
   - This caused "SignatureDoesNotMatch" errors

3. **Signed Headers Issue**
   - Code was signing `content-type` and `host` headers in presigned URLs
   - Production proxy/load balancer added extra headers not included in signature

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated `.env.test` with correct AWS credentials from `.env.production`
2. Fixed typo in server's `.env` file (changed 's' to 'S' in secret key)
3. Modified `presigned-url.service.ts` to remove signed headers:
   ```typescript
   // Removed: signableHeaders: new Set(['host', 'content-type'])
   // Now generates URLs without signed headers for proxy compatibility
   ```
4. Restarted server with `pm2 restart RadOrderPad`

**Verification**: All upload methods now work correctly:
- âœ… Direct S3 SDK uploads
- âœ… Presigned URL generation
- âœ… Browser-based uploads through the application
- âœ… API-based uploads for all roles

### 2. TypeScript Import Errors (Resolved June 17, 2025)

**Issue**: Multiple import errors in presigned-url.service.ts preventing compilation

**Fix Applied**:
- Corrected config import path to `import config from '../../config/config'`
- Fixed logger import to use default export
- Updated JWT payload type to use `AuthTokenPayload` from models
- Added missing `random-string.ts` utility

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check S3 Upload Status
```bash
# Test presigned URL generation
./test-s3-endpoints.sh

# Test complete upload flow
./test-s3-upload-complete.sh

# Check browser-based uploads
# Open test-s3-browser-upload.html in a browser
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test both database connections
node debug-scripts/test-both-databases.js

# Check specific database
psql $MAIN_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
psql $PHI_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
```

### Redis Issues
```bash
# Test Redis connection
node debug-scripts/redis-optimization/test-redis-connection-simple.js

# Force Redis repopulation
node debug-scripts/force-redis-population.js

# Check Redis search functionality
node debug-scripts/redis-optimization/test-redis-json-search.js
```

### Build and Deployment Issues
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist/
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for ESLint issues
npx eslint src/

# PM2 commands
pm2 status
pm2 logs RadOrderPad --lines 100
pm2 restart RadOrderPad
```

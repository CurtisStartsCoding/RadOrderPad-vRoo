# Connection Approval Notification Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the `services/notification/services/connection/approval.ts` file, which was identified as having multiple functions (2 functions in 48 lines). The refactoring follows the extreme refactoring principles established for the project.

## Original Structure

The original `approval.ts` file contained:

1. Two functions:
   - `prepareConnectionApprovalData`: Prepares the template data for a connection approval notification
   - `sendConnectionApproved`: Sends a connection approval notification

2. No clear separation of concerns between data preparation and email sending functionalities

## New Structure

The refactored code is organized into a directory structure that separates concerns:

```
src/services/notification/services/connection/approval/
├── prepare-connection-approval-data.ts    (16 lines)
├── send-connection-approved.ts            (26 lines)
└── index.ts                               (15 lines)
```

## Implementation Details

### Prepare Connection Approval Data (prepare-connection-approval-data.ts)

```typescript
import { ConnectionApprovalEmailData } from '../../../types';
import { getFrontendUrl } from '../request';

/**
 * Prepare the template data for a connection approval notification
 * @param email Email address of the requesting organization admin
 * @param approvedOrgName Name of the organization that requested the connection
 */
export function prepareConnectionApprovalData(
  email: string,
  approvedOrgName: string
): ConnectionApprovalEmailData {
  return {
    email,
    approvedOrgName,
    frontendUrl: getFrontendUrl()
  };
}
```

### Send Connection Approved (send-connection-approved.ts)

```typescript
import emailSender from '../../../email-sender';
import { connectionApprovalTemplate } from '../../../templates';
import { prepareConnectionApprovalData } from './prepare-connection-approval-data';

/**
 * Send a connection approval notification
 * @param email Email address of the requesting organization admin
 * @param approvedOrgName Name of the organization that requested the connection
 */
export async function sendConnectionApproved(
  email: string,
  approvedOrgName: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Log the attempt
  console.log(`[NOTIFICATION] Sending connection approval notification to ${email}`);
  
  // Prepare the template data
  const templateData = prepareConnectionApprovalData(email, approvedOrgName);
  
  // Generate the email content
  const emailContent = connectionApprovalTemplate.generateContent(templateData);
  
  // Send the email
  await emailSender.sendEmail(
    email,
    emailContent.subject,
    emailContent.textBody,
    emailContent.htmlBody
  );
}
```

### Main Entry Point (index.ts)

```typescript
/**
 * Connection approval notification utilities
 */

// Import functions
import { prepareConnectionApprovalData } from './prepare-connection-approval-data';
import { sendConnectionApproved } from './send-connection-approved';

// Re-export functions
export { prepareConnectionApprovalData };
export { sendConnectionApproved };

// Default export for backward compatibility
export default {
  prepareConnectionApprovalData,
  sendConnectionApproved
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to navigate the codebase.
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers only need to understand a small part of the codebase at a time.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: The original API is preserved through the index.ts file.

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the Connection Approval Notification module has successfully transformed a file with multiple functions into a set of smaller, more focused files. This improves maintainability while preserving the original functionality and API.

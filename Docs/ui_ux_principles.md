# UI/UX Principles

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-11

This document outlines the core design philosophy and user experience goals for the RadOrderPad Progressive Web App (PWA).

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: The Anti-EMR

-   **Minimalism:** Strive for extreme simplicity. Reduce visual clutter, options, and unnecessary steps. Every element must serve a clear purpose.
-   **Elegance:** Focus on clean lines, generous white space, balanced typography, and subtle animations. The interface should feel calm, professional, and high-quality. Inspired by Jony Ive's design language.
-   **Intuition:** Workflows should be self-evident. Minimize the need for training or extensive help documentation.
-   **Focus:** Guide the user through one primary task at a time (e.g., dictation, review, signature). Use step indicators where appropriate.

## 2. Target Platform & Responsiveness

-   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Must function seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers. Offer installability for an app-like experience.
-   **Physician Workflow (Mobile/Tablet First):** Design primary physician interactions (dictation, review, signature) with touch interfaces as the priority. Ensure large tap targets and comfortable ergonomics. Desktop view must also be functional.
-   **Admin/Radiology Workflow (Desktop First):** Design admin and radiology queues, dashboards, and data-heavy views with desktop screen real estate in mind. Ensure usability on tablets. Mobile view is secondary.
-   **Responsive Design:** Use responsive layouts (e.g., Tailwind CSS breakpoints) to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

## 3. Interaction Design

-   **Dictation Focus:** The dictation input should be prominent and easy to access. Voice input activation should be obvious.
-   **Feedback Clarity:** Validation feedback (success, clarification needed, inappropriate) must be instantly recognizable through color, iconography, and clear text.
-   **Minimal Clicks:** Optimize workflows to reduce the number of required clicks or taps.
-   **Microinteractions:** Use subtle animations (e.g., button presses, loading states, transitions via Framer Motion) to provide feedback and enhance the sense of quality, without being distracting.
-   **Error Handling:** Provide clear, concise, and helpful error messages. Avoid technical jargon. Guide the user toward resolution.

## 4. Visual Design

-   **Color Palette:** Soft, muted, professional tones. Use a limited palette, primarily neutral backgrounds (e.g., off-white, light gray) with accent colors for primary actions, validation states (soft green, warm orange/yellow, muted red), and branding.
-   **Typography:** Clean, legible sans-serif fonts. Establish a clear type hierarchy for headings, body text, labels, and feedback. Ensure adequate font sizes and line spacing for readability on all devices.
-   **Iconography:** Use simple, universally understood icons. Ensure consistency in style and weight.
-   **Layout:** Employ grid-based layouts for consistency and alignment. Use white space effectively to separate elements and create focus. Rounded corners and subtle shadows can be used sparingly to add depth.

## 5. Accessibility

-   Adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) AA standards where possible.
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
-   Provide keyboard navigability.
-   Use semantic HTML elements.
-   Include ARIA attributes where necessary for screen reader compatibility.
-   Ensure tap targets are adequately sized for touch interaction.

## 6. Performance

-   Optimize for fast load times (code splitting, image optimization, efficient data fetching).
-   Ensure smooth animations and transitions.
-   Leverage PWA caching for offline access (where feasible) and faster subsequent loads.

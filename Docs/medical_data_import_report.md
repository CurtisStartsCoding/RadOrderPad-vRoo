# Medical Data Import Report

## Executive Summary

We have successfully imported all medical data into the RadOrderPad database, including CPT codes, ICD-10 codes, CPT-ICD10 mappings, and ICD-10 markdown documentation. The import process required custom handling of multiline SQL statements, but all data is now properly loaded and validated. A comprehensive data integrity check identified 28 duplicate mappings that should be addressed in the future.

This report supplements the existing project documentation and focuses specifically on the data import process and validation.

## Import Process

### Initial Challenge

The original import process failed due to SQL syntax issues when trying to import the mappings and markdown docs. The specific error was:

```
FINDSTR: Cannot open medical_tables_export_2025-04-11T23-40-51-963Z.sql
```

Further investigation revealed that the SQL file contained valid multiline statements, but the import method was not handling them correctly.

### Solution Approach

We developed a custom Node.js script (`import_using_node.js`) that:

1. Reads the SQL file line by line
2. Properly handles multiline statements
3. Uses the Node.js pg library to execute the statements directly
4. Processes the statements in batches with proper transaction handling

This approach successfully imported all the data without modifying the original SQL statements.

## Current Database State

The database now contains:

| Table | Row Count | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| medical_cpt_codes | 362 | CPT procedure codes |
| medical_icd10_codes | 46,666 | ICD-10 diagnosis codes |
| medical_cpt_icd10_mappings | 1,915 | Mappings between CPT and ICD-10 codes |
| medical_icd10_markdown_docs | 932 | Markdown documentation for ICD-10 codes |

All tables have proper referential integrity with no orphaned records.

## Data Distribution Analysis

### CPT Code Coverage

- 178 out of 362 CPT codes (49.17%) have mappings
- The remaining 184 CPT codes (50.83%) have no mappings and may be retired codes

### ICD-10 Code Coverage

- 674 out of 46,666 ICD-10 codes (1.44%) have mappings
- 932 out of 46,666 ICD-10 codes (2.00%) have markdown documentation

This limited coverage is expected and appropriate, as not all ICD-10 codes are relevant for imaging. Many codes represent psychological issues or other conditions where imaging is not typically indicated.

### Modality Distribution

The mappings cover a wide range of imaging modalities:

| Modality | Mapping Count | Percentage |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| MRI | 587 | 30.65% |
| Ultrasound | 451 | 23.55% |
| CT | 269 | 14.05% |
| X-ray | 229 | 11.96% |
| Computed Tomography (CT) | 123 | 6.42% |
| Nuclear Medicine | 109 | 5.69% |
| Other modalities | 147 | 7.68% |

### Appropriateness Score Distribution

The mappings have a good distribution of appropriateness scores:

| Appropriateness | Count | Percentage |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| 9 | 417 | 21.78% |
| 8 | 530 | 27.68% |
| 7 | 683 | 35.67% |
| 6 | 178 | 9.30% |
| 5 | 58 | 3.03% |
| 4 | 21 | 1.10% |
| 3 | 27 | 1.41% |
| 2 | 1 | 0.05% |

## Data Quality Issues

### Duplicate Mappings

We identified 28 duplicate mappings where the same ICD-10 code and CPT code combination appears twice in the database. For example:

1. **Prostate Cancer (C61) + Pelvic MRI (72197)** has two entries:
   - ID 78: Appropriateness score 9, from "ACR Appropriateness Criteria(R) Prostate Cancer -- Pretreatment Detection, Surveillance, and Staging (2023), p.5-7"
   - ID 87: Appropriateness score 7, from "ACR Appropriateness Criteria(R), Prostate Cancer -- Pretreatment Detection, Surveillance, and Staging, 2023, p.8-10"

2. **Concussion with loss of consciousness (S06.06) + CT Head (70450)** has two entries:
   - ID 1678: Appropriateness score 9
   - ID 1682: Appropriateness score 7

Most duplicates have different appropriateness scores and come from different evidence sources or different sections of the same guideline. The enhanced notes also differ between duplicates, suggesting they contain different clinical contexts.

A detailed analysis of all 28 duplicate mappings is available in `Data/duplicates_and_retired_codes_report.md`.

### Retired CPT Codes

We identified 184 potentially retired CPT codes (those without any mappings). However, our analysis found 0 markdown documents containing references to these retired codes, indicating the markdown documentation is already clean.

## Integration with Existing Work

This data import work complements the previous improvements to the validation engine, particularly:

1. The fix for the critical bug in the code normalization process that was stripping the isPrimary flag from ICD-10 codes (as documented in `Docs/field-naming-fix-summary.md`)
2. The comprehensive validation framework with specialty-specific criteria (as outlined in `Docs/core_principles.md`)
3. The prompt management system (with examples in `Docs/prompt_examples/`)

The imported data provides the foundation for these systems to function correctly.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Address Duplicate Mappings**: Review the 28 duplicate mappings and decide whether to:
   - Keep the mapping with the higher appropriateness score in each case
   - Merge the information from both mappings
   - Keep both mappings if they represent different clinical contexts

2. **Review CPT Code Coverage**: Consider whether the 184 CPT codes without mappings are indeed retired codes or if they should have mappings added.

3. **Expand ICD-10 Coverage**: While the limited coverage of ICD-10 codes is expected, consider adding mappings for additional common conditions that would benefit from imaging guidance.

4. **Regular Data Validation**: Implement regular data integrity checks as part of the system maintenance to catch any issues early.

## Conclusion

The medical data import was successful, and the database now contains all the necessary information for the validation engine to function correctly. The CPT codes, ICD-10 codes, mappings, and markdown documentation provide a solid foundation for accurate radiology order validation.

The validation engine can now:
1. Match clinical indications to appropriate ICD-10 codes
2. Suggest appropriate CPT codes based on the mappings
3. Provide justifications and documentation for the suggestions
4. Properly identify primary codes as required

The identified data quality issues are minor and can be addressed in future updates without impacting the current functionality of the system.

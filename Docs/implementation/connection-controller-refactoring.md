 # Connection Controller Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the `ConnectionController` class from a single large file (249 lines) into a modular structure with smaller, more focused files. The refactoring aims to improve maintainability, readability, and testability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Original Structure

The original `controllers/connection.controller.ts` file contained a single class with multiple methods:

```typescript
// controllers/connection.controller.ts (249 lines)
export class ConnectionController {
  async listConnections(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 15+ lines of code
  }

  async listIncomingRequests(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 15+ lines of code
  }

  async requestConnection(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 45+ lines of code
  }

  async approveConnection(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 35+ lines of code
  }

  async rejectConnection(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 35+ lines of code
  }

  async terminateConnection(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    // 35+ lines of code
  }
}
```

## New Structure

The refactored code is organized into a directory structure with smaller, focused files:

```
src/controllers/connection/
├── auth-utils.ts                      (17 lines)
├── error-utils.ts                     (29 lines)
├── validation-utils.ts                (45 lines)
├── list.controller.ts                 (45 lines)
├── request.controller.ts              (45 lines)
├── approve.controller.ts              (47 lines)
├── reject.controller.ts               (47 lines)
├── terminate.controller.ts            (47 lines)
└── index.ts                           (70 lines)
```

### File Descriptions

1. **auth-utils.ts**
   - Contains utility functions for authentication
   - Provides a common function to check if the user is authenticated and extract user information

2. **error-utils.ts**
   - Contains utility functions for error handling
   - Provides a common function to handle errors in connection controllers

3. **validation-utils.ts**
   - Contains utility functions for parameter validation
   - Provides functions to validate relationship IDs and target organization IDs

4. **list.controller.ts**
   - Contains functions for listing connections and incoming requests
   - Uses the auth-utils and error-utils for common functionality

5. **request.controller.ts**
   - Contains the function for requesting a connection to another organization
   - Uses the auth-utils, validation-utils, and error-utils for common functionality

6. **approve.controller.ts**
   - Contains the function for approving a connection request
   - Uses the auth-utils, validation-utils, and error-utils for common functionality

7. **reject.controller.ts**
   - Contains the function for rejecting a connection request
   - Uses the auth-utils, validation-utils, and error-utils for common functionality

8. **terminate.controller.ts**
   - Contains the function for terminating an active connection
   - Uses the auth-utils, validation-utils, and error-utils for common functionality

9. **index.ts**
   - Re-exports all functionality through a class that implements the original interface
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Implementation Details

### 1. Common Utility Functions

One of the key improvements in this refactoring is the extraction of common functionality into utility files:

```typescript
// src/controllers/connection/auth-utils.ts
export function authenticateUser(req: Request, res: Response): { orgId: number; userId: number } | null {
  if (!req.user) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'User not authenticated' });
    return null;
  }
  
  return {
    orgId: req.user.orgId,
    userId: req.user.userId
  };
}
```

```typescript
// src/controllers/connection/error-utils.ts
export function handleConnectionError(error: unknown, res: Response, controllerName: string): void {
  console.error(`Error in ${controllerName} controller:`, error);
  
  // Error handling logic
}
```

```typescript
// src/controllers/connection/validation-utils.ts
export function validateRelationshipId(req: Request, res: Response): number | null {
  const relationshipId = parseInt(req.params.relationshipId);
  
  if (isNaN(relationshipId)) {
    res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid relationship ID' });
    return null;
  }
  
  return relationshipId;
}
```

### 2. Controller Implementation

Each controller function is implemented in its own file, following a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// src/controllers/connection/list.controller.ts
export async function listConnections(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // Authenticate user
    const user = authenticateUser(req, res);
    if (!user) return;
    
    // Get connections
    const connections = await connectionService.listConnections(user.orgId);
    
    // Return response
    res.status(200).json({ connections });
  } catch (error) {
    handleConnectionError(error, res, 'listConnections');
  }
}
```

### 3. Re-export for Backward Compatibility

```typescript
// src/controllers/connection/index.ts
export class ConnectionController {
  async listConnections(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    return listConnections(req, res);
  }
  
  // Other methods...
}

export default new ConnectionController();
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file is now smaller and focused on a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to navigate the codebase.

3. **Code Reuse**: Common functionality like authentication, error handling, and validation is extracted into reusable utility functions, reducing code duplication.

4. **Easier Testing**: Each controller function can be tested independently, simplifying the testing process.

5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers only need to understand a small part of the codebase at a time, reducing cognitive load.

6. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the controller without conflicts.

## Migration

The refactoring was implemented with backward compatibility in mind:

1. The original file was moved to `old_code/connection.controller.ts` for reference.
2. The import in `src/routes/connection.routes.ts` was updated to use the new module.
3. All tests were run to ensure functionality was preserved.

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the ConnectionController has successfully reduced the file sizes to well below the 150-line guideline while maintaining all existing functionality. The new modular structure improves maintainability, readability, and testability, making it easier for developers to work with the codebase.

The extraction of common functionality into utility files is a significant improvement over the previous approach of splitting by method, as it reduces code duplication and promotes code reuse. This approach should be applied to future refactorings as well.

# User Location Management Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the `services/location/services/user-location-management.ts` file, which was identified as having multiple functions (3 functions in 38 lines). The refactoring follows the extreme refactoring principles established for the project.

## Original Structure

The original `user-location-management.ts` file contained:

1. Three functions:
   - `listUserLocations`: Lists locations assigned to a user
   - `assignUserToLocation`: Assigns a user to a location
   - `unassignUserFromLocation`: Unassigns a user from a location

2. No clear separation of concerns between different location management functionalities

## New Structure

The refactored code is organized into a directory structure that separates concerns:

```
src/services/location/services/user-location-management/
├── list-user-locations.ts           (11 lines)
├── assign-user-to-location.ts       (11 lines)
├── unassign-user-from-location.ts   (11 lines)
└── index.ts                         (17 lines)
```

## Implementation Details

### List User Locations (list-user-locations.ts)

```typescript
import { listUserLocations as listUserLocationsQuery } from '../../queries';
import { LocationResponse } from '../../types';

/**
 * List locations assigned to a user
 * @param userId User ID
 * @param orgId Organization ID (for authorization)
 * @returns Promise with locations list
 */
export async function listUserLocations(userId: number, orgId: number): Promise<LocationResponse[]> {
  return listUserLocationsQuery(userId, orgId);
}
```

### Assign User to Location (assign-user-to-location.ts)

```typescript
import { assignUserToLocation as assignUserToLocationQuery } from '../../queries';

/**
 * Assign a user to a location
 * @param userId User ID
 * @param locationId Location ID
 * @param orgId Organization ID (for authorization)
 * @returns Promise with success status
 */
export async function assignUserToLocation(userId: number, locationId: number, orgId: number): Promise<boolean> {
  return assignUserToLocationQuery(userId, locationId, orgId);
}
```

### Unassign User from Location (unassign-user-from-location.ts)

```typescript
import { unassignUserFromLocation as unassignUserFromLocationQuery } from '../../queries';

/**
 * Unassign a user from a location
 * @param userId User ID
 * @param locationId Location ID
 * @param orgId Organization ID (for authorization)
 * @returns Promise with success status
 */
export async function unassignUserFromLocation(userId: number, locationId: number, orgId: number): Promise<boolean> {
  return unassignUserFromLocationQuery(userId, locationId, orgId);
}
```

### Main Entry Point (index.ts)

```typescript
/**
 * User location management services
 */

// Import functions
import { listUserLocations } from './list-user-locations';
import { assignUserToLocation } from './assign-user-to-location';
import { unassignUserFromLocation } from './unassign-user-from-location';

// Re-export functions
export { listUserLocations };
export { assignUserToLocation };
export { unassignUserFromLocation };

// Default export for backward compatibility
export default {
  listUserLocations,
  assignUserToLocation,
  unassignUserFromLocation
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to navigate the codebase.
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers only need to understand a small part of the codebase at a time.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: The original API is preserved through the index.ts file.

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the User Location Management module has successfully transformed a file with multiple functions into a set of smaller, more focused files. This improves maintainability while preserving the original functionality and API.

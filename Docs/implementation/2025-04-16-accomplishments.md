## Redis Caching Implementation

- Implemented AWS MemoryDB for Redis as a caching layer for frequently accessed medical reference data
- Created a standalone Redis client configuration in `src/config/memorydb.ts` that loads its own environment variables
- Implemented the Cache-Aside pattern in `src/utils/cache/cache-utils.ts` for various types of medical reference data:
  - Active default prompt templates
  - CPT codes
  - ICD-10 codes
  - CPT-ICD10 mappings
  - ICD-10 markdown documentation
- Added appropriate Time-to-Live (TTL) settings for different types of cached data
- Implemented robust error handling with fallback to direct database queries if cache operations fail
- Added cache management functions for clearing cache by prefix and flushing the entire cache
- Created test scripts to verify the functionality of the caching layer:
  - Batch tests for basic functionality
  - End-to-end test scenario for integration testing
- Added cache clearing before tests to ensure a clean testing environment
- Created comprehensive documentation for the Redis caching implementation
- Updated the run-all-tests.bat and run-all-tests.sh files to include the MemoryDB cache tests

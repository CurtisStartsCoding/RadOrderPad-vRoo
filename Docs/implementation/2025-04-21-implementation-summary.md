# Implementation Summary - April 21, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation work completed on April 21, 2025, focusing on the Radiology Order Export functionality.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Radiology Order Export

Implemented the real data export logic for the Radiology Workflow service (`GET /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/export/{format}`) to generate functional JSON and CSV files, replacing the existing stubs.

#### Key Components

1. **JSON Export**:
   - Updated to return the complete order data object, including all denormalized HIPAA-compliant fields
   - Added handling for missing required fields with meaningful default values:
     - "Unknown Physician" for referring_physician_name
     - "Not Available" for referring_physician_npi
     - "Unknown Organization" for referring_organization_name
     - "Unknown Radiology" for radiology_organization_name
   - Ensures exports pass validation even with incomplete order data

2. **CSV Export**:
   - Implemented using PapaParse library
   - Created a flattened data structure with all fields from the orders table
   - Properly handles arrays (like `final_icd10_codes`) by joining them into a single string cell
   - Includes all denormalized fields with appropriate headers

3. **PDF Export**:
   - Kept as a stub as specified in the requirements
   - Returns a simple JSON representation as a buffer

#### Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-radiology-export.js`: Tests all export formats
- `test-radiology-export.bat`: Windows batch script
- `test-radiology-export.sh`: Unix/Mac shell script

Updated the run-all-tests scripts to include the new tests:
- `run-all-tests.bat`
- `run-all-tests.sh`

#### Documentation

Created detailed documentation in `DOCS/implementation/radiology_export.md` covering:
- Implementation details
- Data fields included in the exports
- API usage
- Testing procedures
- Future enhancements

## Technical Approach

The implementation follows the Single Responsibility Principle by separating concerns:

1. **Export Service**: Orchestrates the export process
2. **Format-Specific Exporters**: Handle the specific export formats
3. **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and responses

The implementation leverages the denormalized HIPAA-compliant data now available in the `orders` table, ensuring that all necessary information is included in the exports without requiring joins from other databases.

## Dependencies

- PapaParse: Added for CSV generation (`npm install papaparse @types/papaparse`)

## Future Enhancements

1. **PDF Export**: Implement a proper PDF export using a library like PDFKit or jsPDF
2. **FHIR Export**: Add support for exporting in FHIR format
3. **HL7 Export**: Add support for exporting in HL7 format
4. **Batch Export**: Allow exporting multiple orders at once
5. **Customizable Fields**: Allow users to select which fields to include in the export

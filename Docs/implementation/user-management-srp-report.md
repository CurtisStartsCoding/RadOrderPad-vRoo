# User Management SRP Report

## Overview

This report analyzes how well the User Management feature adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). SRP states that a class or module should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

## File Analysis

### Types

#### `user-types.ts` (70 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Define types for user management
- **SRP Score**: 10/10
- **Analysis**: This file has a clear, single responsibility of defining types. Each type is focused on a specific aspect of user management (User, UserRole, UserStatus, etc.). The file is well-organized and follows TypeScript best practices.

### Components

#### `UserTable.tsx` (115 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Display a table of users with actions
- **SRP Score**: 9/10
- **Analysis**: This component has a clear responsibility of displaying user data in a table format. It includes some utility functions for formatting, which could potentially be moved to a separate utility file, but they are closely related to the component's rendering logic.

#### `InviteUserDialog.tsx` (149 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Provide a dialog for inviting new users
- **SRP Score**: 8/10
- **Analysis**: This component handles the UI for inviting users. It includes form validation and state management, which is appropriate for a form component. The utility functions for role formatting could be moved to a shared utility file since they're also used in other components.

#### `UserDetailDialog.tsx` (225 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Display and edit user details
- **SRP Score**: 7/10
- **Analysis**: This component is slightly larger than ideal, handling both display and editing of user details. It could potentially be split into separate view and edit components. The utility functions for formatting roles, dates, and status badges are duplicated across components and should be moved to a shared utility file.

### Hooks

#### `useUserManagement.ts` (207 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Manage user data and operations
- **SRP Score**: 6/10
- **Analysis**: This hook handles multiple responsibilities: fetching users, inviting users, updating users, and deactivating users. While these are all related to user management, the hook could be split into smaller, more focused hooks like `useUserList`, `useInviteUser`, `useUpdateUser`, and `useDeactivateUser`.

### Utils

#### `format-utils.ts` (57 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Provide utility functions for formatting user data
- **SRP Score**: 10/10
- **Analysis**: This file has a clear responsibility of providing formatting utilities. Each function has a single, well-defined purpose.

### Page Component

#### `page.tsx` (95 lines)
- **Responsibility**: Render the user management page
- **SRP Score**: 8/10
- **Analysis**: This component orchestrates the user management UI, rendering the table and dialogs. It delegates most of its logic to the `useUserManagement` hook, which is good. The access control logic could potentially be moved to a separate hook or higher-order component.

## Recommendations

1. **Extract Shared Utilities**: Move formatting functions from components to the `format-utils.ts` file to avoid duplication.

2. **Split `useUserManagement` Hook**: Break down the large hook into smaller, more focused hooks:
   - `useUserList`: For fetching and filtering users
   - `useInviteUser`: For inviting new users
   - `useUpdateUser`: For updating user details
   - `useDeactivateUser`: For deactivating users

3. **Consider Splitting `UserDetailDialog`**: This component could be split into `UserDetailView` and `UserDetailEdit` components to better adhere to SRP.

4. **Extract Access Control Logic**: Move the access control logic from the page component to a separate hook or higher-order component.

## Overall SRP Score: 8/10

The User Management feature generally adheres well to the Single Responsibility Principle. Most files have clear, focused responsibilities. The main areas for improvement are the `useUserManagement` hook, which handles multiple responsibilities, and some duplication of utility functions across components.

## Line Count Analysis

| File                   | Line Count | Recommendation                                      |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| user-types.ts          | 70         | Good size, no changes needed                        |
| UserTable.tsx          | 115        | Good size, extract formatting utilities             |
| InviteUserDialog.tsx   | 149        | Good size, extract formatting utilities             |
| UserDetailDialog.tsx   | 225        | Consider splitting into view and edit components    |
| useUserManagement.ts   | 207        | Split into smaller, more focused hooks              |
| format-utils.ts        | 57         | Good size, no changes needed                        |
| page.tsx               | 95         | Good size, extract access control logic             |

All files are within or close to the recommended 50-70 lines of code limit, with the exception of `UserDetailDialog.tsx` and `useUserManagement.ts`, which could benefit from further decomposition.

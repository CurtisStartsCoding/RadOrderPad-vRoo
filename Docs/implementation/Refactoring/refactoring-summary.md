### Multi-Function Files

In addition to the large files, we've also refactored several files with multiple functions:

1. `utils/text-processing/code-extractor.ts` (5 functions, 89 lines) - refactored into code-extractor/ directory with:
   - icd10/extract-icd10-codes.ts
   - cpt/extract-cpt-codes.ts
   - common/extract-medical-codes.ts
   - common/is-medical-code.ts
   - common/get-medical-code-category.ts
   - index.ts

2. `services/order/admin/validation.ts` (4 functions, 86 lines) - refactored into validation/ directory with:
   - patient/get-patient-for-validation.ts
   - patient/validate-patient-fields.ts
   - insurance/get-primary-insurance.ts
   - insurance/validate-insurance-fields.ts
   - types.ts
   - index.ts

3. `middleware/auth.middleware.ts` (3 functions, 90 lines) - refactored into auth/ directory with:
   - authenticate-jwt.ts
   - authorize-role.ts
   - authorize-organization.ts
   - types.ts
   - index.ts

4. `services/order/admin/order-status-manager.ts` (3 functions, 89 lines) - refactored into order-status-manager/ directory with:
   - update-order-status.ts
   - validate-patient-data.ts
   - validate-insurance-data.ts
   - index.ts

5. `utils/text-processing/keyword-extractor.ts` (3 functions, 113 lines) - refactored into keyword-extractor/ directory with:
   - extract-medical-keywords.ts
   - extract-categorized-medical-keywords.ts
   - extract-keywords-by-category.ts
   - index.ts

## Refactoring Approach

For each file, we followed a consistent approach:

1. **Analysis**: Identified the responsibilities and functions within the file
2. **Directory Structure**: Created a logical directory structure to organize the refactored files
3. **Function Extraction**: Extracted each function into its own file
4. **Type Extraction**: Moved types and interfaces to dedicated type files when appropriate
5. **Index Creation**: Created index.ts files to re-export functionality and maintain backward compatibility
6. **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation for each refactoring

## Benefits Achieved

The refactoring has resulted in several key benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test
4. **Improved Code Navigation**: Developers can quickly find the code they need
5. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the codebase without conflicts
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers only need to understand a small part of the codebase at a time

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

We've identified additional files that could be candidates for future refactoring:

### Files with 3 or More Functions

1. `services/location/services/user-location-management.ts` (3 functions, 38 lines)
2. `services/notification/services/connection/request.ts` (3 functions, 54 lines)
3. `services/order/admin/clinical-record-manager.ts` (3 functions, 79 lines)
4. `services/order/radiology/order-export.service.ts` (3 functions, 64 lines)

### Files with 2 Functions

1. `controllers/connection/list.controller.ts` (2 functions, 51 lines)
2. `controllers/connection/validation-utils.ts` (2 functions, 49 lines)
3. `services/connection/services/request-connection-helpers.ts` (2 functions, 79 lines)
4. `services/notification/email-sender/test-mode.ts` (2 functions, 34 lines)
5. `services/notification/services/connection/approval.ts` (2 functions, 48 lines)
6. `services/notification/services/connection/rejection.ts` (2 functions, 48 lines)
7. `services/notification/services/connection/termination.ts` (2 functions, 57 lines)
8. `services/order/admin/patient-manager.ts` (2 functions, 91 lines)
9. `services/order/admin/utils/query-builder.ts` (2 functions, 137 lines)
10. `services/order/radiology/export/csv-export.ts` (2 functions, 90 lines)
11. `services/order/radiology/query/order-builder/metadata-filters.ts` (2 functions, 50 lines)
12. `services/order/validation/attempt-tracking.ts` (2 functions, 60 lines)
13. `utils/response/normalizer.ts` (2 functions, 89 lines)
14. `utils/response/validator.ts` (2 functions, 43 lines)

## Conclusion

The refactoring effort has successfully transformed large, complex files into smaller, more focused modules. This has improved the maintainability and organization of the codebase, making it easier for developers to understand, modify, and test the code.

The project now adheres to the 150-line guideline for all major files, and we've made significant progress in implementing the "one function per file" principle. Future refactoring efforts can build on this foundation to further improve the codebase.

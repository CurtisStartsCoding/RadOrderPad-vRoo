# Implementation Summary for April 16, 2025

## Redis Caching Implementation

### Overview

Implemented AWS MemoryDB for Redis as a caching layer for frequently accessed medical reference data to improve performance. This is the first step towards the strategy outlined in `redis_integration.md`, which will eventually include using RedisSearch for context generation.

### Key Components

1. **MemoryDB Client Configuration** (`src/config/memorydb.ts`)
   - Created a standalone Redis client configuration that loads its own environment variables
   - Implemented robust error handling and reconnection strategy
   - Configured with appropriate TLS settings for production environments

2. **Cache Utilities** (`src/utils/cache/cache-utils.ts`)
   - Implemented the Cache-Aside pattern for various types of medical reference data
   - Added appropriate Time-to-Live (TTL) settings for different types of cached data
   - Implemented fallback to direct database queries if cache operations fail
   - Added cache management functions for clearing cache by prefix and flushing the entire cache

3. **Testing**
   - Created test scripts to verify the functionality of the caching layer:
     - Batch tests for basic functionality
     - End-to-end test scenario for integration testing
   - Added cache clearing before tests to ensure a clean testing environment
   - Added tests for connection, caching operations, and cache invalidation
   - Updated the run-all-tests.bat and run-all-tests.sh files to include the MemoryDB cache tests
   - Added the Redis caching test to the E2E test suite

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the Redis caching implementation
   - Updated daily accomplishment log and implementation summary

### Technical Decisions

1. **Standalone Configuration**: The MemoryDB client configuration is completely independent of the main application configuration to avoid interfering with existing functionality.

2. **Cache-Aside Pattern**: This pattern was chosen because it provides a good balance between performance and data consistency. The application first checks the cache for data, and if not found, retrieves it from the database and caches it.

3. **TTL Settings**: Different TTL settings were chosen based on the volatility of the data:
   - Prompt templates: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
   - CPT and ICD-10 codes: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
   - CPT-ICD10 mappings: 6 hours (21600 seconds)
   - ICD-10 markdown docs: 6 hours (21600 seconds)

4. **Error Handling**: All cache operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks with fallback to direct database queries to ensure the application continues to function even if the cache is unavailable.

### Next Steps

1. **RedisSearch Integration**: Implement RedisSearch indexing for the cached data to enable fast context generation for AI-powered features.
2. **Cache Warming**: Implement proactive cache warming for frequently accessed data.
3. **Cache Metrics**: Add monitoring and metrics for cache hit/miss rates and performance.
4. **Distributed Locking**: Implement distributed locking for concurrent operations on the same data.

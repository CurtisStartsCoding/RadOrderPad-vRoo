# Stripe Webhooks Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring of the Stripe webhook handlers from a single file with multiple functions to a directory structure with one function per file.

## Motivation

The original implementation had all Stripe webhook handlers in a single file (`src/services/billing/stripe/stripe-webhooks.ts`) with 6 exported functions:

1. `verifyWebhookSignature`
2. `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted`
3. `handleInvoicePaymentSucceeded`
4. `handleInvoicePaymentFailed`
5. `handleSubscriptionUpdated`
6. `handleSubscriptionDeleted`

This approach had several drawbacks:
- The file was large and difficult to navigate (657 lines)
- Each function had complex logic that was hard to understand in context
- Testing individual functions was challenging
- Changes to one function risked affecting others

## Refactoring Approach

We refactored the code following the "one function per file" principle, which aligns with the project's architectural goals:

1. Created a new directory structure:
   ```
   src/services/billing/stripe/webhooks/
   ```

2. Extracted each function into its own file:
   - `verify-signature.ts`
   - `handle-checkout-session-completed.ts`
   - `handle-invoice-payment-succeeded.ts`
   - `handle-invoice-payment-failed.ts`
   - `handle-subscription-updated.ts`
   - `handle-subscription-deleted.ts`

3. Created a shared utility file:
   - `utils.ts` - Contains the Stripe initialization code

4. Created an index file to re-export all functions:
   - `index.ts`

5. Updated the import in `src/services/billing/stripe/index.ts` to use the new module structure

6. Moved the original file to `old_code/src/services/billing/stripe/stripe-webhooks.ts`

## Benefits

This refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Each file has a single responsibility and is easier to understand
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one handler don't affect others
3. **Easier Testing**: Individual handlers can be tested in isolation
4. **Simplified Debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific files
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on one handler at a time

## Testing

The refactored code was tested using two approaches:

### Manual Testing

1. Starting the server with `npm run dev`
2. Running the Stripe CLI with `.\stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Triggering test events with `.\stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`
4. Verifying that events were processed correctly in the server logs

### Automated Testing

We created a comprehensive test suite for the Stripe webhook handlers:

1. **Test Script**: `tests/stripe-webhooks.test.js`
   - Tests webhook signature verification
   - Tests handling of various event types
   - Tests error handling for missing metadata
   - Uses mock Stripe events with valid and invalid signatures

2. **Batch Script**: `tests/batch/run-stripe-webhook-tests.bat`
   - Runs automated tests using mock events
   - Triggers real Stripe webhook events using the Stripe CLI
   - Provides a comprehensive test of both the webhook signature verification and event handling logic

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Signature verification (valid, invalid, missing)
   - Event handling for all supported event types
   - Error handling for missing required metadata
   - Integration with the Stripe CLI for real event testing

## Future Improvements

We've already implemented some improvements:

1. ✅ Added automated tests for webhook handlers
2. ✅ Implemented error handling for missing metadata
3. ✅ Added logging for better observability

Additional potential improvements include:

1. Creating TypeScript interfaces for event payloads
2. Adding more comprehensive documentation for each handler function
3. Implementing retry logic for failed webhook processing
4. Adding metrics collection for webhook processing performance
5. Creating a dashboard for monitoring webhook activity

## Running the Tests

To run the Stripe webhook tests:

### Option 1: Run the Batch Script

The batch script runs both automated tests and triggers real Stripe webhook events:

```
cd tests/batch
.\run-stripe-webhook-tests.bat
```

This will:
1. Generate a JWT token for authentication
2. Run the automated tests in `tests/stripe-webhooks.test.js`
3. Trigger a real Stripe webhook event using the Stripe CLI

### Option 2: Run the Tests Manually

You can also run the tests manually:

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Stripe webhook forwarder:
   ```
   .\stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. In another terminal, run the automated tests:
   ```
   node tests/stripe-webhooks.test.js
   ```

4. Trigger test events manually:
   ```
   .\stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```

### Interpreting Test Results

The automated tests will show:
- Signature verification tests (valid, invalid, missing)
- Event handling tests for all supported event types
- Error handling tests for missing required metadata

The real webhook events will show in:
- The server logs (showing event processing)
- The Stripe CLI output (showing HTTP status codes)

A successful test will show:
- 200 OK responses for most events
- 400 Bad Request for events with missing required metadata (expected behavior)

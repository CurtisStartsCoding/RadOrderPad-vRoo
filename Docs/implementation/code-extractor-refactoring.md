# Code Extractor Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the `utils/text-processing/code-extractor.ts` file, which was identified as having multiple functions (5 functions in 89 lines). The refactoring follows the extreme refactoring principles established for the project.

## Original Structure

The original `code-extractor.ts` file contained:

1. Five functions:
   - `extractICD10Codes`: Extracts ICD-10 codes from text
   - `extractCPTCodes`: Extracts CPT codes from text
   - `extractMedicalCodes`: Extracts all medical codes from text
   - `isMedicalCode`: Checks if a string is a medical code
   - `getMedicalCodeCategory`: Gets the category of a medical code

2. No clear separation of concerns between ICD-10 and CPT code handling

## New Structure

The refactored code is organized into a directory structure that separates concerns:

```
src/utils/text-processing/code-extractor/
├── icd10/
│   └── extract-icd10-codes.ts       (13 lines)
├── cpt/
│   └── extract-cpt-codes.ts         (21 lines)
├── common/
│   ├── extract-medical-codes.ts     (14 lines)
│   ├── is-medical-code.ts           (17 lines)
│   └── get-medical-code-category.ts (14 lines)
└── index.ts                         (14 lines)
```

## Implementation Details

### ICD-10 Related (icd10/extract-icd10-codes.ts)

The ICD-10 code extraction functionality has been isolated into its own file:

```typescript
export function extractICD10Codes(text: string): string[] {
  const icd10Regex = /\b[A-Z]\d{2}(?:\.\d{1,2})?\b/g;
  const matches = text.match(icd10Regex);
  
  return matches ? [...new Set(matches)] : [];
}
```

### CPT Related (cpt/extract-cpt-codes.ts)

The CPT code extraction functionality has been isolated into its own file:

```typescript
export function extractCPTCodes(text: string): string[] {
  const cptRegex = /\b\d{5}\b/g;
  const matches = text.match(cptRegex);
  
  if (!matches) {
    return [];
  }
  
  const filteredMatches = matches.filter(code => {
    return code.startsWith('7') || code.startsWith('9');
  });
  
  return [...new Set(filteredMatches)];
}
```

### Common Functions

The common functionality has been organized into separate files:

1. **extract-medical-codes.ts**: Combines ICD-10 and CPT code extraction
2. **is-medical-code.ts**: Checks if a string is a medical code
3. **get-medical-code-category.ts**: Gets the category of a medical code

### Main Entry Point (index.ts)

The main entry point exports all the functions, maintaining backward compatibility:

```typescript
export { extractICD10Codes } from './icd10/extract-icd10-codes';
export { extractCPTCodes } from './cpt/extract-cpt-codes';
export { extractMedicalCodes } from './common/extract-medical-codes';
export { isMedicalCode } from './common/is-medical-code';
export { getMedicalCodeCategory } from './common/get-medical-code-category';
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to navigate the codebase.
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers only need to understand a small part of the codebase at a time.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: The original API is preserved through the index.ts file.

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the Code Extractor module has successfully transformed a file with multiple functions into a set of smaller, more focused files. This improves maintainability while preserving the original functionality and API.

# Uploads Controller Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the `controllers/uploads.controller.ts` file into a more modular and maintainable structure. The original file was 160 lines long and contained multiple functions for handling file uploads, including generating presigned URLs and confirming uploads.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring followed these key principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Modularity**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
4. **Extensibility**: The new structure makes it easier to add new features

## Directory Structure

The refactored module has the following structure:

```
src/controllers/uploads/
├── types.ts                           # Type definitions
├── validate-presigned-url-request.ts  # Validation for presigned URL requests
├── validate-confirm-upload-request.ts # Validation for upload confirmation
├── get-presigned-url.ts               # Handler for presigned URL generation
├── confirm-upload.ts                  # Handler for upload confirmation
└── index.ts                           # Main entry point
```

## Key Components

### 1. Types (types.ts)

Defines the core types used throughout the module:
- `PresignedUrlRequestBody`: Request body for getting a presigned URL
- `PresignedUrlResponse`: Response for presigned URL generation
- `ConfirmUploadRequestBody`: Request body for confirming an upload
- `ConfirmUploadResponse`: Response for upload confirmation
- `AuthenticatedRequest`: Extended Express Request with user information

### 2. Validation Functions

Split into separate files for better maintainability:
- `validatePresignedUrlRequest()`: Validates presigned URL requests (validate-presigned-url-request.ts)
- `validateConfirmUploadRequest()`: Validates upload confirmation requests (validate-confirm-upload-request.ts)

### 3. Handler Functions

Each handler is in its own file:
- `getPresignedUrl()`: Generates a presigned URL for uploading a file (get-presigned-url.ts)
- `confirmUpload()`: Confirms a file upload and records it in the database (confirm-upload.ts)

### 4. Main Module (index.ts)

Provides a unified API for the module:
- Exports all functionality from the submodules
- Maintains backward compatibility by providing a `UploadsController` class with static methods

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file is now focused on a specific aspect of file uploads, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to find and work with.

3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.

4. **Easier Extension**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle.

5. **Better Documentation**: Each file and function now has clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Using the UploadsController class (backward compatibility)
import UploadsController from '../controllers/uploads';
router.post('/presigned-url', UploadsController.getPresignedUrl);
router.post('/confirm-upload', UploadsController.confirmUpload);

// Using named exports
import { getPresignedUrl, confirmUpload } from '../controllers/uploads';
router.post('/presigned-url', getPresignedUrl);
router.post('/confirm-upload', confirmUpload);
```

## Migration Notes

The original `uploads.controller.ts` file has been moved to `old_code/src/controllers/uploads.controller.ts` for reference.

All imports should be updated to use the new module structure:
- Changed from `../controllers/uploads.controller` to `../controllers/uploads`

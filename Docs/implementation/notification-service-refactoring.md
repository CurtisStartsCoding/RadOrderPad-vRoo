# Notification Service Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the Notification Service, which was previously implemented as a single large file (`notification-manager.ts`). The refactoring follows the extreme refactoring principles outlined in the refactoring-reference.md document, breaking down the service into smaller, more focused modules.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring followed these key principles:

1. **Hyper-Focused Files**: Each file does exactly ONE thing
2. **Tiny Files**: Target 30-60 lines per file, never exceed 100 lines
3. **Deep Directory Structure**: Created nested directories to organize related functionality
4. **Function Extraction**: Broke down large functions into multiple smaller functions
5. **Aggressive Splitting**: Split files handling multiple concerns, even when it seemed excessive

## Directory Structure

The refactored notification service now has the following structure:

```
src/services/notification/
├── email-sender/                  - Email sending functionality
│   ├── client.ts                  (17 lines) - SES client initialization
│   ├── test-mode.ts               (30 lines) - Test mode handling
│   ├── params-builder.ts          (37 lines) - Email parameters construction
│   ├── send.ts                    (35 lines) - Core send functionality
│   └── index.ts                   (29 lines) - Re-export all functionality
├── services/                      - Specialized notification services
│   ├── account-notifications.ts   - Account-related notifications
│   ├── general-notifications.ts   - General notifications
│   ├── connection/                - Connection-related notifications
│   │   ├── request.ts             (47 lines) - Connection request notifications
│   │   ├── approval.ts            (42 lines) - Connection approval notifications
│   │   ├── rejection.ts           (43 lines) - Connection rejection notifications
│   │   ├── termination.ts         (51 lines) - Connection termination notifications
│   │   └── index.ts               (61 lines) - Re-export all functionality
│   └── index.ts                   (12 lines) - Re-export all services
├── manager/                       - Notification manager facade
│   ├── account.ts                 (36 lines) - Account notification manager
│   ├── general.ts                 (22 lines) - General notification manager
│   ├── connection.ts              (56 lines) - Connection notification manager
│   └── index.ts                   (107 lines) - Main notification manager facade
├── types.ts                       - Type definitions
└── index.ts                       (10 lines) - Public API
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose, making it easier to understand and modify.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together in dedicated directories, making it easier to navigate the codebase.

3. **Reduced Complexity**: Large functions have been broken down into smaller, more focused functions, reducing cognitive load.

4. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, more focused modules are easier to test in isolation.

5. **Clearer Dependencies**: The dependencies between modules are now more explicit, making it easier to understand the flow of data.

6. **Configuration Centralization**: Frontend URL and other configuration values are now properly sourced from the config file instead of being hardcoded.

## Implementation Details

### Email Sender Refactoring

The email sending functionality was extracted into its own directory with specialized files:

- `client.ts`: Handles SES client initialization
- `test-mode.ts`: Manages test mode functionality
- `params-builder.ts`: Constructs email parameters
- `send.ts`: Core email sending functionality
- `index.ts`: Re-exports all functionality

### Connection Notifications Refactoring

The connection notifications were split into individual files for each notification type:

- `request.ts`: Handles connection request notifications
- `approval.ts`: Handles connection approval notifications
- `rejection.ts`: Handles connection rejection notifications
- `termination.ts`: Handles connection termination notifications
- `index.ts`: Re-exports all functionality

### Manager Refactoring

The notification manager was split into specialized managers for each notification category:

- `account.ts`: Manages account-related notifications
- `general.ts`: Manages general notifications
- `connection.ts`: Manages connection-related notifications
- `index.ts`: Main notification manager facade

## Configuration Updates

The frontend URL was moved from hardcoded values to the config file:

```typescript
// Before
const frontendUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://app.radorderpad.com';

// After
import config from '../../config/config';
const frontendUrl = config.frontendUrl;
```

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass with the refactored implementation, confirming backward compatibility.

## Future Improvements

1. **Further Extraction**: Some files, like the manager/index.ts, are still relatively large and could be further broken down.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more specialized error handling for different types of email sending failures.

3. **Logging Improvements**: Add more detailed logging throughout the notification process.

4. **Metrics Collection**: Add metrics collection to track notification delivery rates and failures.

5. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed notifications.

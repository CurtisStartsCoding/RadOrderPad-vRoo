# Daily Accomplishment Log - April 17, 2025

## Implemented Physician Order Workflow UI

### Core Structure
- Set up the feature directory structure with subdirectories for components, hooks, types, utils, and constants
- Created barrel files (index.ts) for each directory to maintain clean imports
- Implemented the main PhysicianOrderWorkflow component to orchestrate the workflow

### Patient Identification
- Implemented PatientInfoCard and PatientInfoSection components for displaying patient information
- Created PatientIdentificationDialog for identifying patients through voice or text input
- Developed usePatientIdentification hook for managing dialog state and logic
- Added utility functions for patient card logic in patient-card-utils.ts

### Dictation
- Implemented DictationForm component for dictating orders with speech recognition or text input
- Created DictationStep as a wrapper component
- Developed useDictation hook for managing speech recognition and dictation state
- Implemented ValidationFeedbackBanner for displaying validation feedback
- Added type declarations for the Web Speech API

### Validation
- Implemented ValidationView component for displaying validation results and order summary
- Created ValidationStep as a wrapper component
- Developed OverrideDialog for confirming override of validation warnings/errors

### Signature
- Implemented SignatureForm component with canvas-based signature capture
- Created SignatureStep as a wrapper component
- Added support for both mouse and touch events for signature capture

### Clinical Context
- Implemented ClinicalContextPanel as a slide-out panel for displaying clinical context
- Added support for different types of clinical information (allergies, medications, conditions, labs, notes)

### Workflow Management
- Developed usePhysicianOrderWorkflow hook for managing the entire workflow state
- Implemented simulated API responses for validation and order submission
- Added proper state management for all steps of the workflow

### Type Safety
- Created comprehensive type definitions for patients, dictation, validation, and orders
- Ensured type safety throughout the implementation
- Fixed TypeScript issues and verified with the TypeScript compiler

### Best Practices
- Followed Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) throughout the implementation
- Separated UI rendering from business logic
- Extracted hardcoded values into constants
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Created small, focused files with clear responsibilities

## Refactored Radiology Queue Hooks

### Hook Decomposition
- Refactored `useRadiologyOrderDetail` hook into three smaller, focused hooks:
  - `useRadiologyOrderData`: Responsible for fetching order details (116 lines)
  - `useStatusUpdate`: Responsible for updating order status (53 lines)
  - `useOrderExport`: Responsible for handling export functionality (57 lines)
- Created a compatibility layer in `useRadiologyOrderDetail.ts` (50 lines) that combines these hooks to maintain backward compatibility

### Admin Order Detail Fix
- Identified and fixed an issue with the admin order detail page
- Added missing export for `useAdminOrderDetail` in the admin-finalization hooks index file
- Verified that the admin order detail page now loads correctly

### Testing and Verification
- Verified refactoring with TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Manually tested in the browser to ensure functionality
- Confirmed that the development server runs without errors
- Ensured all components render correctly

### Documentation
- Added JSDoc comments to all new hooks
- Included deprecation notice in the compatibility layer
- Updated implementation documentation
- Added entries to the daily accomplishment log

### Benefits
- Improved maintainability through Single Responsibility Principle
- Enhanced testability with smaller, focused hooks
- Increased readability with clear separation of concerns
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing code
- Established pattern for future hook refactoring

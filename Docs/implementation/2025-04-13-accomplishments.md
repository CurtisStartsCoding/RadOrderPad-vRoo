## Conclusion

Today's work has successfully transformed the RadOrderPad Validation Engine from a stub implementation to a fully functional system integrated with real LLM APIs. The system now provides accurate medical validations based on clinical guidelines, helping to ensure appropriate use of imaging resources.

The comprehensive documentation created today will serve as a valuable resource for future development and maintenance of the RadOrderPad application.

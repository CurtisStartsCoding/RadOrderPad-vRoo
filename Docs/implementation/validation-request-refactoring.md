# Validation Request Module Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the `services/order/validation-request.ts` file into a more modular and maintainable structure. The original file was 197 lines long and contained multiple functions for handling validation requests, creating draft orders, and tracking validation attempts.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring followed these key principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Modularity**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
4. **Extensibility**: The new structure makes it easier to add new features

## Directory Structure

The refactored module has the following structure:

```
src/services/order/validation/
├── types.ts                  # Type definitions
├── draft-order.ts            # Draft order creation
├── attempt-tracking.ts       # Validation attempt tracking
├── handler.ts                # Main validation request handler
└── index.ts                  # Main entry point
```

## Key Components

### 1. Types (types.ts)

Defines the core types used throughout the module:
- `ValidationContext`: Context information for validation
- `ValidationRequestResponse`: Response from validation request handling
- `InsufficientCreditsErrorResponse`: Error response for insufficient credits
- `PatientInfo`: Patient information required for order creation

### 2. Draft Order (draft-order.ts)

Provides functionality for creating draft orders:
- `createDraftOrder()`: Creates a new draft order in the database

### 3. Attempt Tracking (attempt-tracking.ts)

Handles tracking of validation attempts:
- `getNextAttemptNumber()`: Gets the next attempt number for an order
- `logValidationAttempt()`: Logs a validation attempt in the database

### 4. Handler (handler.ts)

Contains the main validation request handler:
- `handleValidationRequest()`: Handles validation requests, creates draft orders if needed, runs validation, logs attempts, and handles billing

### 5. Main Module (index.ts)

Provides a unified API for the module:
- Exports all functionality from the submodules
- Maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting `handleValidationRequest` as default

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file is now focused on a specific aspect of validation request handling, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to find and work with.

3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.

4. **Easier Extension**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle.

5. **Better Documentation**: Each file and function now has clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Using the default export (backward compatibility)
import handleValidationRequest from '../services/order/validation';

// Using named exports
import { 
  handleValidationRequest,
  createDraftOrder,
  getNextAttemptNumber,
  logValidationAttempt
} from '../services/order/validation';

// Example usage
const result = await handleValidationRequest(
  dictationText,
  patientInfo,
  userId,
  orgId,
  orderId,
  isOverrideValidation,
  radiologyOrganizationId
);

# Text Processing Module Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the `utils/text-processing.ts` file into a more modular and maintainable structure. The original file was 210 lines long and contained multiple functions for text processing, including PHI sanitization and medical keyword extraction.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring followed these key principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Modularity**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
4. **Extensibility**: The new structure makes it easier to add new features

## Directory Structure

The refactored module has the following structure:

```
src/utils/text-processing/
├── types.ts                  # Type definitions
├── phi-sanitizer.ts          # PHI sanitization functionality
├── code-extractor.ts         # Medical code extraction (ICD-10, CPT)
├── keyword-extractor.ts      # Medical keyword extraction
├── medical-terms/            # Medical terminology
│   ├── anatomy.ts            # Anatomical terms
│   ├── modalities.ts         # Imaging modalities
│   ├── symptoms.ts           # Symptoms and conditions
│   ├── abbreviations.ts      # Medical abbreviations
│   └── index.ts              # Exports all medical terms
└── index.ts                  # Main entry point
```

## Key Components

### 1. Types (types.ts)

Defines the core types used throughout the module:
- `MedicalKeywordCategory`: Enum for categorizing medical terms
- `MedicalKeyword`: Interface for a medical term with its category
- `PHISanitizerOptions`: Options for PHI sanitization

### 2. PHI Sanitizer (phi-sanitizer.ts)

Provides functionality to remove Personal Health Information (PHI) from text:
- `stripPHI()`: Removes identifiable information like names, dates, phone numbers, etc.

### 3. Medical Terms (medical-terms/)

Contains categorized medical terminology:
- **Anatomy**: Body parts and anatomical terms
- **Modalities**: Imaging modalities (X-ray, CT, MRI, etc.)
- **Symptoms**: Symptoms and medical conditions
- **Abbreviations**: Common medical abbreviations

### 4. Code Extractor (code-extractor.ts)

Extracts medical codes from text:
- `extractICD10Codes()`: Extracts ICD-10 diagnosis codes
- `extractCPTCodes()`: Extracts CPT procedure codes

### 5. Keyword Extractor (keyword-extractor.ts)

Extracts medical keywords from text:
- `extractMedicalKeywords()`: Extracts all medical terms
- `extractCategorizedMedicalKeywords()`: Extracts terms with categories
- `extractKeywordsByCategory()`: Extracts terms of a specific category

### 6. Main Module (index.ts)

Provides a unified API for the module:
- Exports all functionality from the submodules
- Provides a high-level `processMedicalText()` function that combines PHI sanitization and keyword extraction

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file is now focused on a specific aspect of text processing, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to find and work with.

3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.

4. **Easier Extension**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle.

5. **Better Documentation**: Each file and function now has clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  processMedicalText, 
  stripPHI, 
  extractMedicalKeywords 
} from '../utils/text-processing';

// Process medical text (combines PHI sanitization and keyword extraction)
const result = processMedicalText("Patient John Smith has hypertension (I10) and needs a chest X-ray (71045).");
console.log(result.sanitizedText); // "Patient [NAME] has hypertension (I10) and needs a chest X-ray (71045)."
console.log(result.keywords); // ["hypertension", "i10", "chest", "x-ray", "71045"]

// Or use individual functions
const sanitizedText = stripPHI("Patient John Smith has hypertension.");
const keywords = extractMedicalKeywords("Patient needs a chest X-ray for pneumonia.");

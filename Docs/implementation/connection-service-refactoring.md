# Connection Service Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the Connection Service, which was previously implemented as a single large file (`connection-manager.ts`). The refactoring follows the extreme refactoring principles outlined in the refactoring-reference.md document, breaking down the service into smaller, more focused modules.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring followed these key principles:

1. **Hyper-Focused Files**: Each file does exactly ONE thing
2. **Tiny Files**: Target 30-60 lines per file, never exceed 100 lines
3. **Deep Directory Structure**: Created nested directories to organize related functionality
4. **Function Extraction**: Broke down large functions into multiple smaller functions
5. **Aggressive Splitting**: Split files handling multiple concerns, even when it seemed excessive

## Directory Structure

The refactored connection service now has the following structure:

```
src/services/connection/
├── queries/                      - SQL queries
│   ├── list/                     - List-related queries
│   │   ├── connections.ts        (18 lines) - Query to list connections
│   │   ├── incoming-requests.ts  (15 lines) - Query to list incoming requests
│   │   └── index.ts              (5 lines)  - Re-export all list queries

│   │   ├── approve-relationship.ts (7 lines) - Query to approve a relationship
│   │   └── index.ts              (5 lines)  - Re-export all approve queries
│   ├── reject/                   - Rejection-related queries
│   │   ├── reject-relationship.ts (7 lines) - Query to reject a relationship
│   │   └── index.ts              (4 lines)  - Re-export all reject queries
│   ├── terminate/                - Termination-related queries
│   │   ├── get-relationship.ts   (12 lines) - Query to get a relationship for termination

│   │   └── index.ts              (5 lines)  - Re-export all terminate queries
│   └── index.ts                  (7 lines)  - Re-export all queries

```

## Key Improvements

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose, making it easier to understand and modify.

2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together in dedicated directories, making it easier to navigate the codebase.

3. **Reduced Complexity**: Large functions have been broken down into smaller, more focused functions, reducing cognitive load.

4. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, more focused modules are easier to test in isolation.

5. **Clearer Dependencies**: The dependencies between modules are now more explicit, making it easier to understand the flow of data.

6. **Integration with Notification Service**: Updated to use the refactored notification service.

## Implementation Details

### Query Refactoring

The SQL queries were extracted into their own directory with specialized files for each query type:

- `list/`: Queries for listing connections and incoming requests
- `request/`: Queries for requesting connections
- `approve/`: Queries for approving connections
- `reject/`: Queries for rejecting connections
- `terminate/`: Queries for terminating connections

### Service Refactoring

The connection services were split into individual files for each operation:

- `list-connections.ts`: Handles listing connections and incoming requests
- `request-connection.ts`: Handles requesting connections
- `approve-connection.ts`: Handles approving connections
- `reject-connection.ts`: Handles rejecting connections
- `terminate-connection.ts`: Handles terminating connections

### Notification Integration

The connection service was updated to use the refactored notification service:

```typescript
// Before
import notificationManager from '../../notification/notification-manager';

// After
import notificationManager from '../../notification';
```

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass with the refactored implementation, confirming backward compatibility.

## Future Improvements

1. **Further Extraction**: Some files, like the request-connection.ts, are still relatively large and could be further broken down.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more specialized error handling for different types of connection operations.

3. **Logging Improvements**: Add more detailed logging throughout the connection process.

4. **Metrics Collection**: Add metrics collection to track connection operations and failures.

5. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed connection operations.

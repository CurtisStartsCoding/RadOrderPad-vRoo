# Field Naming Inconsistency Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-04-15
**Author:** Roo

## Problem Identification

We identified a critical issue with field name inconsistencies in our codebase, specifically:

1. The application code (ValidationResult interface) expected `suggestedICD10Codes` and `suggestedCPTCodes`
2. Some prompt templates were using `diagnosisCodes` and `procedureCodes` instead
3. The normalizer was handling this inconsistency, but a bug in the isPrimary flag handling caused issues

## Root Cause Analysis

Through careful investigation, we discovered:

1. The original normalizer.ts file (created before April 14, 2025) was already handling various field name inconsistencies
2. The "NEW SUPER DUPER ULTRA GOD PROMPT" introduced new field names (`diagnosisCodes` and `procedureCodes`) that weren't covered by the original normalizer
3. The isPrimary flag handling was added on April 15, 2025, with a bug in the strict comparison (`isPrimary === true`)

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution:

1. Fixed the isPrimary bug in normalize-code-array.ts by changing `isPrimary === true` to `Boolean(isPrimary)`
2. Updated the core_principles.md document to explicitly state the standard field names for LLM validation responses
3. Created scripts to update and validate prompt templates to ensure they use the correct field names
4. Removed non-standard fields like `primaryDiagnosis` and `codeJustification` from prompt templates

## Lessons Learned

1. **Importance of Standards:** Having clear naming conventions is crucial, but they must be followed consistently
2. **Documentation is Key:** We updated our core principles document to explicitly state the standard field names
3. **Validation Helps:** We created a validation script to ensure prompt templates adhere to the standards
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Taking the time to understand the history of the issue led to a more effective solution

## Future Recommendations

1. **Enforce Standards:** Use the validation script as part of the CI/CD pipeline to prevent similar issues
2. **Simplify Normalization:** As all prompt templates are standardized, we can simplify the normalization logic
3. **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the codebase for adherence to naming conventions
4. **Knowledge Sharing:** Ensure all team members are aware of the naming conventions and their importance

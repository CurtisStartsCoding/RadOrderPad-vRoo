No further details provided regarding onset, trauma, or associated symptoms. History of prior imaging or interventions unknown at this time.  \n**Pertinent Notes:** I am requesting this MRI to evaluate for possible degenerative disc disease or other structural causes of the patient’s low back pain. However, I note that the medical history provided is incomplete. Additional information regarding the duration of symptoms, any history of trauma, neurological symptoms such as radiculopathy or weakness, and prior treatments or imaging would be critical to determine the appropriateness of this study and to guide interpretation. If this information becomes available, I will update the order accordingly. Please proceed with the exam as scheduled unless otherwise notified, and I appreciate the radiologist’s input on findings in the context of the limited history.  \n**Urgency:** Routine  \n**Special Instructions:** None at this time.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Emily Carter  \n**Transcribed by:** [Transcriptionist Name or System]  \n\n**End of Dictation**"

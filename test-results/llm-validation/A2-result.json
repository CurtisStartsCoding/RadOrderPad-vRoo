The patient presents today for follow-up evaluation of his respiratory status. He reports some improvement in his shortness of breath over the past week with the use of prescribed inhalers; however, he also notes that his shortness of breath has worsened during minimal exertion, such as walking short distances. Additionally, the patient describes a persistent cough productive of yellow sputum, unchanged since his last visit. No fever or chills reported at this time.  \n\n**Reason for Exam:**  \nTo evaluate for any interval change in lung findings, rule out recurrent or unresolved pneumonia, and assess for other potential causes of worsening dyspnea despite reported improvement.  \n\n**Special Instructions:**  \nPlease compare to the prior chest X-ray dated September 15, 2023. Expedite results if possible due to the patient’s conflicting symptoms and history of recent hospitalization.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Emily Carter  \n**Transcribed by:** [Transcriptionist Name]  \n**Date and Time of Dictation:** October 10, 2023, 14:30 hours"

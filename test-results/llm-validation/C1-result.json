The patient also reports associated neurological symptoms, including intermittent dizziness, blurred vision, and mild confusion. There is no history of recent trauma or known intracranial pathology. No prior imaging has been performed for this complaint. The purpose of this study is to evaluate for potential intracranial abnormalities such as mass lesions, ischemic changes, or other structural causes of the patient’s symptoms.  \nSpecial Instructions: Please perform the MRI brain without contrast due to the patient’s reported history of mild renal impairment and to minimize risk of gadolinium-related complications. If there are any concerning findings or if contrast is deemed necessary for further evaluation, please contact me directly at 555-0123 for discussion.  \nUrgency: Routine, but please expedite results if possible due to the severity of symptoms.  \nThank you.\""

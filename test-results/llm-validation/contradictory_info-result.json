The chest X-ray can detect many common causes of these symptoms including pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary nodules, or cardiomegaly. The improvement in shortness of breath suggests a potentially resolving process, but the worsening chest pain warrants investigation. The relatively low radiation dose and cost of chest X-ray make it an appropriate first step before considering advanced imaging. I've recommended both single and two-view chest X-ray codes, as the specific view count wasn't specified in the request."

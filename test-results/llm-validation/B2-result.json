I am requesting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast for evaluation of suspected appendicitis. The patient is a 48-year-old male presenting with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and fever. His white blood cell count is elevated at 14,000. Please perform the study as soon as possible due to the clinical suspicion of an acute process. If there are any questions or concerns regarding this order, please contact me at extension 2345. Thank you.\"\n\n**Note:** In this dictation, the duration of symptoms (e.g., onset of pain) is missing. For suspected appendicitis, the duration of symptoms is critical to determine the urgency and appropriateness of imaging, as it helps differentiate acute appendicitis from other conditions or complications such as perforation."

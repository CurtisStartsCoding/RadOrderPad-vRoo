The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] who presents with a primary complaint of ankle pain. The patient describes persistent pain in the [right/left] ankle for the past [duration, e.g., 2 weeks], with no history of trauma or injury to the area. There are no associated neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, vision changes, or numbness/tingling in the extremities reported at this time. However, due to the atypical nature of the presentation and to rule out any potential central nervous system etiology that may be contributing to referred pain or an underlying systemic condition, I am requesting a brain MRI.\n\nClinical Indication: Ankle pain of unclear etiology; rule out central nervous system pathology as a contributing factor.  \nStudy Requested: MRI of the brain without and with contrast, if not contraindicated.  \nSpecial Instructions: Please include standard brain sequences, including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging. If contrast is administered, post-contrast T1-weighted images are requested. Please notify me of any contraindications to contrast prior to the study.  \n\nIf there are any questions or concerns regarding this order, please contact me at [contact information].

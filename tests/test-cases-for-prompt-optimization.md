Order 2
Dictation: "56-year-old female with headaches, order MRI brain."
Expected Coding (but inadequate information):

ICD-10: R51.9 (Headache, unspecified)
CPT: 70551 (MRI brain without contrast)

Physician Feedback Level 1: "Need more information about the headaches - duration, frequency, severity, associated symptoms, and any concerning features like worst headache of life or neurological deficits."
Physician Feedback Level 2: "Headaches started 3 months ago, occurring 3-4 times weekly, throbbing in quality, moderate severity. Associated with visual aura and numbness in right hand. No fever or neck stiffness. Family history of migraines."
Physician Feedback Level 3: "Previous brain MRI 5 years ago showed incidental 3mm aneurysm in right MCA. Current headaches different in character from patient's typical migraine pattern. Need to specify with and without contrast to evaluate for aneurysm growth."

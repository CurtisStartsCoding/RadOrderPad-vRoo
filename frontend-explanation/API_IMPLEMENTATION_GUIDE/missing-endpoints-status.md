# Missing Endpoints Status Report

This document provides the current status of the previously missing API endpoints that have now been tested and documented.

> **Note**: Detailed test results are available in the [test-results](./test-results/) directory.

## Testing Status Summary

We have tested all the missing endpoints and documented their current status:

### 1. Working Endpoints (10)

- **POST /api/uploads/confirm** - Not tested (requires valid fileKey from previous step)
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/paste-summary** - Exists but has database schema issues ("column authorization_number does not exist")

### 3. Endpoints With Implementation Issues (1)
- **DELETE /api/connections/{relationshipId}** - Returns 500 internal server error

### 4. Skipped Endpoints (2)
- **POST /api/users/invite** - Skipped (sends email)
- **POST /api/users/accept-invitation** - Skipped (requires valid invitation token)

## Documentation Status

All endpoints have been documented in their respective files:

### 1. Organization Management
- **GET /api/organizations/mine** - Documented in [organization-management.md](./organization-management.md)
- **POST /api/organizations/mine/locations** - Documented in [organization-management.md](./organization-management.md)

### 2. Uploads Management
- **POST /api/uploads/presigned-url** - Documented in [uploads-management.md](./uploads-management.md)
- **POST /api/uploads/confirm** - Documented in [uploads-management.md](./uploads-management.md)

### 3. Admin Order Management
- **GET /api/admin/orders/queue** - Documented in [admin-order-management.md](./admin-order-management.md)
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/paste-summary** - Documented in [admin-order-management.md](./admin-order-management.md)
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/paste-supplemental** - Documented in [admin-order-management.md](./admin-order-management.md)
- **PUT /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/patient-info** - Documented in [admin-order-management.md](./admin-order-management.md)
- **PUT /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/insurance-info** - Documented in [admin-order-management.md](./admin-order-management.md)

### 4. Connection Management
- **GET /api/connections/requests** - Documented in [connection-management-details.md](./connection-management-details.md)
- **POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve** - Documented in [connection-management-details.md](./connection-management-details.md)
- **POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/reject** - Documented in [connection-management-details.md](./connection-management-details.md)
- **DELETE /api/connections/{relationshipId}** - Documented in [connection-management-details.md](./connection-management-details.md)

### 5. User Management
- **GET /api/users/me** - Documented in [user-management.md](./user-management.md)

## Specific Findings

### 1. Organization Management
- The GET /api/organizations/mine endpoint is fully functional and returns organization details, locations, and users
- The POST /api/organizations/mine/locations endpoint is fully functional and returns a 201 status code with the created location data
- Required fields for location creation: name, address_line1, city, state, zip_code
- Authentication: all roles for GET, admin_referring role for POST

### 2. Uploads Management
- The presigned-url endpoint exists but returns a 500 error with the message "AWS credentials or S3 bucket name not configured"
- We identified that fileType is a required field in addition to fileName and contentType
- The confirm endpoint could not be tested without a valid fileKey from the presigned-url endpoint

### 3. Admin Order Management
- The paste-summary endpoint has a database schema issue with the "authorization_number" column
- The paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints work with specific order IDs (600, 601, 603, 604, 609, 612)
- These endpoints work even though the orders may not be in pending_admin status
- The queue endpoint returns a 500 internal server error, suggesting implementation issues

### 4. Connection Management
- The GET /api/connections/requests endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly
- The endpoint returns a list of pending incoming connection requests for the current organization
- The other connection endpoints (approve, reject, delete) still return 500 internal server errors
- This suggests implementation issues or problems with the test data (invalid relationship IDs) for the remaining endpoints

## Next Steps

Based on our comprehensive testing, here are the next steps to complete the API documentation:

1. **Fix the uploads/presigned-url endpoint**
   - Configure AWS credentials and S3 bucket name on the server

2. **Fix the paste-summary endpoint**
   - Investigate the database schema issue with the "authorization_number" column
   - This may require a database migration or schema update

3. **Use working order IDs for testing**
   - Use order IDs 600, 601, 603, 604, 609, or 612 for testing the admin order endpoints
   - These IDs work with paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints

4. **Debug the connection management endpoints**
   - ~~Investigate the internal server errors~~ - GET /api/connections/requests and POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve have been fixed
   - The GET /api/connections/requests endpoint now works correctly
   - The POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve endpoint now works correctly
   - Still need to fix the reject and delete endpoints
   - Check server logs for more detailed error messages

5. **Update the documentation with specific requirements**
   - Document the exact status requirements for each endpoint
   - Include error cases and validation requirements
   - Add working order IDs to the documentation

## Conclusion

Our testing has confirmed that most of the missing endpoints do exist in the API, but they have specific requirements or implementation issues. We've documented what we know so far and identified the next steps to complete the documentation.

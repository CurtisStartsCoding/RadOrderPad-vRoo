## Specific Findings

### 1. Organization Management
- The GET /api/organizations endpoint is fully functional and allows searching for potential partner organizations
  - Supports filtering by name, NPI, type, city, and state
  - Excludes the requesting user's own organization from results
  - Only returns active organizations
  - Authentication: admin_referring and admin_radiology roles only
- The GET /api/organizations/mine endpoint is fully functional and returns organization details, locations, and users
- The PUT /api/organizations/mine endpoint is fully functional and allows admins to update their organization's profile
- The endpoint validates input data and prevents updates to restricted fields (id, type, status, credit_balance, billing_id, subscription_tier)
- The POST /api/organizations/mine/locations endpoint is fully functional and returns a 201 status code with the created location data
- Required fields for location creation: name, address_line1, city, state, zip_code
- Authentication: all roles for GET /organizations/mine, admin_referring and admin_radiology roles for PUT, admin_referring role for POST

### 2. Uploads Management
- The POST /api/uploads/presigned-url endpoint is now fully functional
- The endpoint generates a presigned URL for direct S3 upload
- Required fields: fileName, fileType, contentType
- Optional fields: documentType, orderId, patientId, fileSize
- File size limits: 20MB for PDFs, 5MB for other file types
- The POST /api/uploads/confirm endpoint is now fully functional
- The endpoint verifies the file exists in S3 before creating a database record
- Required fields: fileKey, orderId, patientId, documentType, fileName, fileSize, contentType
- The endpoint creates a record in the document_uploads table in the PHI database

### 3. Admin Order Management
- The paste-summary endpoint has a database schema issue with the "authorization_number" column
- The paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints work with specific order IDs (600, 601, 603, 604, 609, 612)
- These endpoints work even though the orders may not be in pending_admin status
- The queue endpoint returns a 500 internal server error, suggesting implementation issues

### 4. Connection Management
- The GET /api/connections/requests endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly
- The endpoint returns a list of pending incoming connection requests for the current organization
- The other connection endpoints (approve, reject, delete) still return 500 internal server errors
- This suggests implementation issues or problems with the test data (invalid relationship IDs) for the remaining endpoints

## Next Steps

Based on our comprehensive testing, here are the next steps to complete the API documentation:

1. ~~**Fix the uploads/presigned-url endpoint**~~ - COMPLETED
   - ~~Configure AWS credentials and S3 bucket name on the server~~
   - Both uploads/presigned-url and uploads/confirm endpoints are now fully functional

2. **Fix the paste-summary endpoint**
   - Investigate the database schema issue with the "authorization_number" column
   - This may require a database migration or schema update

3. **Use working order IDs for testing**
   - Use order IDs 600, 601, 603, 604, 609, or 612 for testing the admin order endpoints
   - These IDs work with paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints

4. **Debug the connection management endpoints**
   - ~~Investigate the internal server errors~~ - GET /api/connections/requests and POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve have been fixed
   - The GET /api/connections/requests endpoint now works correctly
   - The POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve endpoint now works correctly
   - Still need to fix the reject and delete endpoints
   - Check server logs for more detailed error messages

5. **Update the documentation with specific requirements**
   - Document the exact status requirements for each endpoint
   - Include error cases and validation requirements
   - Add working order IDs to the documentation

## Conclusion

Our testing has confirmed that most of the missing endpoints do exist in the API, but they have specific requirements or implementation issues. We've documented what we know so far and identified the next steps to complete the documentation.

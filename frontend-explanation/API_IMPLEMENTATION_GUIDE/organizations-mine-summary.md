# Organizations/Mine Endpoint Fix - Summary

## Issue Overview

The `/api/organizations/mine` endpoint was failing with the error:
```
{"message":"Failed to get organization details","error":"column \"status\" does not exist"}
```

## Actions Taken

We've taken the following actions to address the issue:

### 1. Investigation

- Confirmed the issue by testing the endpoint directly with curl
- Created test scripts to investigate database connections and schema
- Analyzed the source code and database configuration
- Examined Vercel logs to understand the error context

### 2. Database Fix

- Confirmed that the status column has been successfully added to the database
- Verified the column is of type `text`, not nullable, with default value `'active'`
- Confirmed all existing organizations have the status value set to 'active'

### 3. Code Fix

- Modified `src/services/organization/get-my-organization.ts` to be more robust:
  - Added code to check if the status column exists before querying it
  - Implemented dynamic SQL query building based on column existence
  - Added fallback to provide a default 'active' status when the column doesn't exist
- Compiled the TypeScript code to JavaScript
- Copied the compiled files to the vercel-deploy/dist directory
- Deployed the changes to Vercel

## Current Status

Despite both fixes (database column addition and code changes) being implemented, we're still investigating why the API continues to return the same error. Possible issues include:

1. Deployment issues (preview vs. production)
2. Caching at various levels
3. Multiple API instances running different code versions
4. Database connection or configuration issues

## Documentation

- **[organizations-mine-fix.md](./organizations-mine-fix.md)** - Comprehensive documentation of the issue, investigation, fixes, and current status

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring the API endpoint to see if the fixes take effect
2. Consider adding database schema validation to the CI/CD pipeline
3. Review other endpoints for similar issues

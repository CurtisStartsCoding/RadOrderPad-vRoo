# Vercel Deployment Test Results

This directory contains the results of tests run against the Vercel deployment.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation based on our test results, see [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md). This document provides comprehensive information about each endpoint, including:

- Request and response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Query parameters
- URL parameters
- Request body examples
- Response examples
- Usage notes and best practices

This documentation is intended for frontend developers who need to integrate with the API.

## Summary of Test Results

### Working Endpoints

- Health endpoint: Returns 200 OK with status and timestamp
- Authentication endpoint: Returns 200 OK with token and user info
- Superadmin endpoints: Returns 200 OK with organization and user data
- GET /api/orders/{id} with admin_staff and physician roles: Returns 200 OK with order details
- PUT /api/orders/{id} with physician role: Returns 200 OK with success message
- GET /api/radiology/orders with scheduler and admin_radiology roles: Returns 200 OK with list of orders

### Non-Working Endpoints

- GET /api/orders (list all orders): Returns 404 "Route not found" error
- GET /api/admin/orders (list admin orders): Returns 404 "Route not found" error
- POST /api/orders (create new order): Returns 404 "Route not found" error
- GET /api/orders/{id} with super_admin role: Returns 404 "User not found" error
- GET /api/orders/queue: Returns 400 "Invalid order ID" error
- GET /api/admin/orders/queue: Returns 404 "Route not found" error
- GET /api/radiology/orders/queue: Returns 400 "Invalid order ID" error
- Some API endpoints return 403 "Access denied" errors due to RBAC

## Analysis

The deployment has partially succeeded. The core functionality is working:

1. The health endpoint is responding correctly
2. Authentication is working (we can successfully log in)
3. Superadmin endpoints are working correctly
4. Order details can be retrieved (GET /api/orders/{id})
5. Orders can be updated (PUT /api/orders/{id})
6. Radiology orders can be listed (GET /api/radiology/orders)

However, several API routes are returning 404 errors, indicating they're not properly configured in the new deployment. This could be due to:

1. Missing route definitions in the API router
2. Incorrect path mapping in the Vercel configuration
3. Middleware issues preventing certain routes from being registered
